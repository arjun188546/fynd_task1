"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. 

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. 


We were seated immediately. 

Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). 

Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. 

When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. 

Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The initial high expectations are immediately dashed upon arrival and a continuous stream of negative experiences follows.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only truly positive aspect mentioned is that they ""were seated immediately."" The comment about the lamp going out being a ""nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls"" is sarcastic, highlighting another negative (boring decor), not a genuine positive.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Iffy parking.
    *   Restaurant appearance didn't live up to signage/expectations.
    *   Unmemorable/unappealing art.
    *   Waiter was ""off"" and ""insanely snobby.""
    *   Waiter disappeared for long periods (10-15 minutes).
    *   Poor drink service (had to be flagged down for refills).
    *   Food took 45 minutes.
    *   Lamp above table went out, and they sat in the dark for 5 minutes before staff noticed.
    *   Boring beige walls.
    *   Became ""too tired"" to eat the food at the restaurant due to the long wait.
    *   Food combination was unappetizing/odd (""didn't go down too easily"").
    *   High price ($90) for a bad meal.
    *   Felt compelled to eat due to cost, despite disliking it.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The reviewer uses strong negative language such as ""thought twice immediately,"" ""insanely snobby,"" ""ridiculous"" (for service), ""45 minutes, easily,"" ""didn't go down too easily,"" ""compelled to finish as much as we could stand,"" and explicitly states ""recommending that you not go there, why bother?"" This indicates extreme dissatisfaction and frustration.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, ""since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?"" This is a clear and unequivocal recommendation *against* visiting the restaurant.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the pervasive negative experiences covering ambiance, service, wait times, food quality, value for money, and an explicit non-recommendation, the lowest possible rating is warranted. The single positive point (being seated immediately) is completely overshadowed by a multitude of significant failures.","```json

"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The review starts with a positive intent (supporting a cause) but quickly pivots to describing a consistently bad experience.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only truly positive aspects are extremely mild: ""We got our order out fine"" (which is a basic expectation, not a highlight) and ""The Philadelphia roll was decent."" These are heavily outweighed by numerous negatives.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Experience was ""subpar to say the least.""
    *   Service was ""HORRENDOUS"" despite the restaurant being almost empty.
    *   Waitress ""disappeared"" after taking the order.
    *   Reviewer almost had to get their own refills.
    *   Sushi was ""overpriced for what it was.""
    *   California roll was ""really bad.""
    *   Waitress didn't return to collect payment, even when the restaurant was practically empty, forcing the reviewer to pay with cash they happened to have.
    *   Implies they would have been stuck there indefinitely due to service.
    *   States they have ""no intention of ingesting there food ever again!""
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and negative. Words and phrases like ""subpar to say the least,"" ""HORRENDOUS,"" ""dissappeared,"" ""almost get refills for us myself,"" ""so overpriced,"" ""really bad,"" ""waisting away there,"" and ""no intention of ingesting there food ever again!"" demonstrate extreme dissatisfaction and frustration.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, ""I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!"" which is a definitive statement of non-recommendation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** With numerous severe complaints about both service and food quality/value, extremely strong negative language, and an explicit refusal to ever return, the review clearly warrants the lowest possible rating.","```json

"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back",1,1,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. Phrases like 'The only reason 1 star can be given', 'SMALLEST wings I have ever seen', 'must be off of baby chicks', 'getting punked', and 'Never to be back' all point to extreme dissatisfaction.
2.  **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are no specific positive aspects mentioned. The phrase 'The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste' is not a positive; it implies that the flavor choices and taste were the *reason* for the bare minimum 1-star rating, rather than a redeeming quality. It's more likely implying that the flavor/choices were so unremarkable or bad that they contribute to the low rating.
3.  **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The primary complaints are the extremely small size of the wings ('SMALLEST wings I have ever seen', 'off of baby chicks'), the feeling of being 'punked' or cheated, and general dissatisfaction with 'flavor choices and taste' (as the justification for the 1-star rating).
4.  **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is very intense and uses strong negative descriptors. Capitalization of 'SMALLEST', hyperbole ('baby chicks'), and expressing disbelief ('getting punked, actually LOL') contribute to a sense of extreme disappointment and anger. 'Never to be back' is a definitive and strong statement of rejection.
5.  **Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states 'Never to be back', which unequivocally means they would not recommend this place.
6.  **Assigned Rating:** Based on the complete absence of positive remarks, the highly intense and numerous negative complaints, the feeling of being cheated, and the definitive statement of not returning, the review clearly indicates the lowest possible rating. The reviewer even explicitly says 'The only reason 1 star can be given', setting the floor for the rating themselves.","```json

"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! 

The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!",1,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly very negative. The review starts and ends with expressions of anger and frustration.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:** There are no positive aspects mentioned in the review. Even the 'reasonable age' customer service person was described as unhelpful.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Staff are described as 'incredibly useless' and hard to find.
    *   The store has poor signage, leading to aimless wandering.
    *   The store was out of stock on a needed item.
    *   Staff members (both the older lady and the customer service representative) were unhelpful and unwilling to assist further (e.g., checking the back, calling another store).
    *   The reviewer repeatedly promises never to return.
    *   The reviewer recommends competitors (Hobby Lobby or Michaels) as being 'worth the drive!!!'.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language used is highly intense and emotional:
    *   'angry', 'can't resist writing a review!'
    *   'incredibly useless'
    *   'always wander aimlessly'
    *   'stormed out soooo mad'
    *   'this time I promise to never go back' (emphasizing a final decision after previous disappointments)
    *   Multiple exclamation marks are used to convey strong emotion.

5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'this time I promise to never go back' and recommends competitors, clearly indicating they would *not* recommend this place.

6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the complete absence of positive feedback, the extensive list of severe negative experiences, the strong emotional language, and the explicit statement of never returning while recommending competitors, a 1-star rating is the most appropriate reflection of this review.","```json

"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner.

Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good.",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses extreme frustration and dissatisfaction throughout the entire review.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** There are no specific positive aspects mentioned about the food, service, ambiance, or value. The 'reverse happy hour' is mentioned as a reason for visiting, but no positive experience related to it is detailed.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    * Perceived 'overpriced entrees'.
    * Major service failure: Being told they couldn't order dinner because the kitchen had closed, after they had already finished appetizers and were ready to order entrees.
    * Lack of communication: No warning about the kitchen closing, especially after informing staff they were there for dinner.
    * Poor timing: Being informed 'five minutes after it did close'.
    * Repeated negative experiences: 'fourth time we've given this place a [chance] and got crappy service.' This indicates a systemic issue and a breaking point for the reviewer.
    * Poor service: The bartender only receiving a 'buck tip' is a direct reflection of dissatisfaction.
    * Inconvenience: Having to 'go find another restaurant for dinner'.
    * Loss of customer: A definitive statement of 'won't be giving them another chance'.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language used is highly intense and emotional. Phrases like 'overpriced entrees', 'crappy service', 'buck tip', 'Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance', and the repeated 'Not good Gordon B.

"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer initially went with a positive intent (to share a beloved dessert), the actual experience was highly disappointing and frustrating.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   'comfortable patio' while waiting.
    *   'greeted warmly by a male host.'
    *   Glasses of water were delivered promptly.
    *   The male host's explanation about the mousse being made daily and cracks being normal was an attempt at reassurance (though the reviewer didn't fully accept it).
    *   The dessert 'was OK' (very faint praise, almost neutral).
    *   The cousin liked the orange and chocolate combination, which she usually doesn't.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   **Server's (Butai) attitude:** Gave a 'look of pure distaste,' 'very cold treatment,' 'awful, condescending look,' didn't deserve a tip, showed 'displeasure' for ordering only dessert, 'sub-par service.' This is a major point of contention.
    *   **Dessert quality & presentation:** 'stale-looking mousse,' 'cracked edges,' green tea ice cream had 'ice crystals' (interpreted as old/re-frozen), presentation was not 'lovely' as before, 'definitely not up to par,' 'mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing' rather than 'silky-smooth chocolate decadence.'
    *   **Overall experience:** 'didn't like the energy in that room,' lost interest in dining there, confirmed by other Yelp friends' poor experiences, reviewer 'never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore,' 'won't be returning.'
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and emotional in its negativity: 'pure distaste,' 'very cold treatment,' 'stale-looking,' 'ice crystals...sign that it is old,' 'definitely not up to par,' 'awful, condescending look,' 'didn't deserve it,' 'sub-par service and dessert,' 'never going to recommend,' 'won't be returning.'
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore,' and 'Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.' This is a clear no to recommendations and future visits.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The strong negative sentiment, severe complaints about service and food quality/presentation (especially given the reviewer was a returning customer with prior positive experiences), coupled with the explicit non-recommendation and declaration of not returning, overwhelmingly points to the lowest possible rating.","```json

While the reviewer initially went with a positive intent (to share a beloved dessert), the actual experience was highly disappointing and frustrating.\n2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**\n    *   'comfortable patio' while waiting.\n    *   'greeted warmly by a male host.'\n    *   Glasses of water were delivered promptly.\n    *   The male host's explanation about the mousse being made daily and cracks being normal was an attempt at reassurance (though the reviewer didn't fully accept it).\n    *   The dessert 'was OK' (very faint praise, almost neutral).\n    *   The cousin liked the orange and chocolate combination, which she usually doesn't.\n3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**\n    *   **Server's (Butai) attitude:** Gave a 'look of pure distaste,' 'very cold treatment,' 'awful, condescending look,' didn't deserve a tip, showed 'displeasure' for ordering only dessert, 'sub-par service.'

"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.

I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!",1,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer explicitly states being 'really disappointed' and lists multiple significant issues without a single positive remark.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are no positive aspects mentioned in the review.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects:** The reviewer complains about the lobby, salsa bar, and drink station being 'very dirty and unkept.' Furthermore, the food itself was poor, with 'old dark colored guacamole' and 'limp lettuce.'
4. **Intensity of Language:** The language is quite strong: 'really disappointed,' 'very dirty and unkept' (repeatedly for multiple areas), 'old dark colored guacamole,' and 'limp lettuce.' These describe fundamental failures in hygiene and food quality.
5. **Recommendation:** The reviewer clearly would not recommend this place in its current state. The closing statement, 'I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!', is a plea for improvement, not an endorsement.
6. **Star Rating:** Given the complete absence of any positive points, multiple severe hygiene issues, and significant food quality problems described with strong negative language, a 1-star rating is the only logical choice.

"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)",1,1,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** Very Negative. The review recounts a significant negative event (theft) followed by severe disappointment with the staff's reaction and a litany of complaints about the store's condition and general employee behavior.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only positive aspect is 'My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21'. This is a very minor positive, concerning only the merchandise, and is immediately overshadowed by 'but the store was such a mess'.
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   A customer's bag (hundreds of dollars worth) was stolen while shopping in the store.
    *   Forever 21 staff reacted poorly to the theft: 'did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences. They just shrugged their shoulders.'
    *   The store was 'such a mess', with 'clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.'
    *   'Way too few staff members working'.
    *   Many working staff were 'socializing' instead of helping customers or maintaining the store.
    *   An example of poor staff priority: 'a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos'.
    *   Implied security issue, mentioning 'someone stealing bags from other customers'.
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite intense and critical. Phrases like 'so disappointed', 'just shrugged their shoulders', 'such a mess', 'chaos', and the sarcastic 'band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin' convey strong negative feelings. The concluding warning 'hold on to your bags :)' reinforces the severity of the experience.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The concluding sentence, 'So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)' is a direct and strong warning to potential customers, effectively advising against shopping there unless extreme caution is taken due to safety concerns and poor service. This is a clear deterrent rather than a recommendation.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the theft, the shocking indifference of the staff to a crime, the deplorable store conditions, and the widespread poor staff performance, coupled with a strong warning to future customers, the review indicates an extremely unsatisfactory experience. The single minor positive about the clothing is completely eclipsed by the overwhelming negatives. Therefore, a 1-star rating is appropriate.","```json

"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho.",1,1,"Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the star rating:

1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. Despite a couple of very minor positives, the reviewer expresses deep dissatisfaction with the food, price, and overall value, culminating in a highly sarcastic and critical closing.

2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   ""I did not get ill from the food here"" (This is a low bar, particularly given the graphic context of getting sick from other food in Phoenix, but it's explicitly stated as a positive outcome for this specific deli).
    *   ""..the fries were good tho."" (A very minor positive, almost an afterthought, suggesting only one component out of several was satisfactory).

3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   The place ""ain't seedy enough"" for the reviewer's personal preference (though not a direct fault of the deli).
    *   Coleslaw was ""soggy.""
    *   Sandwiches were *not* ""HUGE"" as advertised/expected, leading to disappointment about portion size and value.
    *   The sandwich was ""flavorless"" and tasted like ""stale bread.""
    *   Significant price complaints: ""$12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???"" and ""$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!)"" indicating a strong belief the food was overpriced.
    *   The sarcastic suggestion to fund a trip to New York for a ""more realistic scale"" of Kosher food and heritage is a powerful condemnation of the deli's authenticity and quality.

4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and critical:
    *   Graphic details about getting sick in Phoenix sets a low bar for this deli's 'positive' (not getting sick).
    *   ""However...."" signals a strong shift to negative feedback.
    *   ""nope."" is used emphatically to contradict expectations.
    *   ""thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread."" is a very strong condemnation of taste.
    *   ""effin sandwich!!!"" uses an expletive to express extreme frustration over price.
    *   The sarcastic closing about New York is cutting and implies utter failure by the deli to deliver a good experience.

5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The reviewer's actions (giving money for a trip to New York for *real* Kosher food) and direct complaints about flavor, size, and price clearly indicate they would not recommend this establishment. The few positives are completely dwarfed by the volume and intensity of the negatives.

6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming negativity, the intense language, the numerous specific complaints about food quality, portion size, and price, and the clear implicit disrecommendation, this review unequivocally warrants a **1-star** rating. The two minor positives (didn't get sick, good fries) are not nearly enough to balance the significant, core failures highlighted.","```json

"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.

The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?""
Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   

Sincerely,
Morgan",1,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses extremely strong, offensive, and sarcastic language throughout the entire review, indicating deep anger and frustration.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The only positive aspect mentioned is, ""I like Ra for the atmosphere,"" but this is immediately negated by the following phrase, ""something you completely ruined."" This indicates that even the one potential positive was overshadowed and destroyed by the negative experience.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The reviewer complains about being rushed by the waitress (""they want to go home too""), feeling singled out and unfairly treated, the waitress taking longer to process the bill than it took to eat the food, the waitress giving the wrong amount of change and not being able to count it, and ultimately, the waitress ruining the atmosphere and the overall experience.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly intense, aggressive, and offensive. Phrases like ""What the fuck, bitch,"" ""staying all fucking night,"" ""Dear Ra Waitress"" (used sarcastically to set up a scathing critique), and accusations like ""you don't know how to count"" demonstrate extreme dissatisfaction and personal animosity.
5. **Would Recommend This Place:** Based on the intense negativity, the ruined atmosphere, and the multiple significant complaints, the reviewer would absolutely not recommend this place, at least not after this experience. The review is written to deter others and express severe displeasure.

"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.

The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip.",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer explicitly states, 'The whole experience was pretty bad' and concludes with 'Not worth the trip.'
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only mention that isn't negative is 'Pani Puri was OK.' This is lukewarm at best and does not counteract the numerous severe negatives.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Hair in the food (multiple instances in the same dish) - a major hygiene and quality issue.
    *   Poor ordering process/lack of clear instructions.
    *   Food generally 'does not taste good.'
    *   Confusing soda policy and unhelpful staff interaction regarding it.
    *   Counter staff described as 'down right dismissive.'
    *   Specific dishes: Papdi Chaat - 'boring, no flavor'; Bhel Puri - 'boring and no flavor' (even before finding hair).

Phrases like 'Not just 1 but 2,' 'whole experience was pretty bad,' 'food does not taste good,' and 'down right dismissive' convey deep dissatisfaction and disgust. The final 'Not worth the trip' is a definitive negative recommendation.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Not worth the trip,' indicating a strong non-recommendation.

While the initial paragraph is neutral to slightly positive about convenience, the bulk of the review describes two highly negative and emotionally charged experiences. The reviewer uses strong, accusatory language.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned**: The only minor positive mentioned is the convenience of having a Wells Fargo inside, but this is immediately tempered by noting there's one across the street anyway. This small positive is completely overshadowed by the subsequent complaints.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints**: The review details two significant negative experiences:
    *   A customer rudely confronting the reviewer's sister for speaking a non-English language, which the reviewer perceives as racial animosity and 'arrogance'.
    *   An employee loudly and, according to the reviewer, aggressively telling a child she couldn't play the lottery machine, which the reviewer describes as 'verbal abuse' and 'Racial profiling'.
4. **Intensity of language used**: The language is extremely intense and emotional. Phrases like 'WTF?!?', 'rudely says', 'make every race hate you even more', 'arrogance', 'rushes over and in a loud voice', 'verbal abuse', and 'Racial profiling' convey strong anger, frustration, and a sense of injustice.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place**: Based on the severe negative experiences and the strong accusations (racial animosity from a customer, verbal abuse and racial profiling from an employee), there is no indication the reviewer would recommend this place. On the contrary, the tone suggests deep dissatisfaction and a warning to others.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars**: Given the minor positive aspect being completely overwhelmed by two highly negative, emotionally charged incidents involving both a customer and an employee, and the use of extremely strong, accusatory language, a 1-star rating is the only logical conclusion.

"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast ""elites"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) 

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)",1,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer uses intense, derogatory, and sarcastic language throughout the entire review to describe every aspect of the establishment.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** There are no genuine positive aspects mentioned about Skip & Jan's. Any statements that seem mildly factual (e.g., Jagermeister on tap, pool tables) are immediately followed by negative descriptions or sarcastic remarks. The 'not all bad news' section is entirely sarcastic, implying fear of theft and potential illness.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The list of complaints is extensive and severe:
    *   Described as the 'grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot'.
    *   Parking lot implies low-value clientele, leading the reviewer to park far away.
    *   'Crappy old wood paneling' and 'circa 1955 high school cafeteria' furniture.
    *   'Less than regal' atmosphere.
    *   'Faded felt' on pool tables and unhappy-looking patrons (implying gambling).
    *   Smell described as 'extreme humanity' – a century's worth of 'spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food'.
    *   Taco meat described as 'Holy Crap, was that disgusting!', 'ground 'creature'', and an 'ocean of brown/orange grease'. The reviewer could not eat it.
    *   Wings were 'boiled' and 'wet' rather than crispy.
    *   Karaoke announcement was the 'final straw' for leaving.
    *   Sarcastic relief at not having car stolen and only having a 'rough morning' (implying food-related illness).
    *   Framed the entire experience as 'shared adversity'.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is exceptionally intense, vivid, and highly critical. Words like 'disgusting', 'grimy', 'greasy', 'grubby', 'gross', 'crappy', 'extreme humanity', 'vomit', 'urine', 'spoiled food', 'ground creature', and 'ocean of brown/orange grease' are used to paint a picture of utter revulsion. Sarcasm is heavily employed to underscore the negative experience.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Absolutely not. The entire review is a scathing condemnation, concluding with a sarcastic 'thank you' for making the group 'nearly invincible' through shared adversity, indicating a truly terrible experience.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the pervasive and extreme negativity, the disgusting descriptions of food and ambiance, and the complete lack of any genuine positive remarks, this review unequivocally warrants a 1-star rating.","```json

"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",1,2,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is mixed but leans strongly negative due to severe food complaints, despite clear appreciation for the atmosphere.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The reviewer loves the 'casual night time festivities,' 'watching people ride the mechanical bull,' the 'fun atmosphere,' and notes 'very unique and fun desserts and drinks' like the 'giant pile of cotton candy' and the 'pretty badass' beer tower. They explicitly state they 'will continue to come for the fun atmosphere.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The food is described as 'disgusting,' 'dry and cold.' Specific items like the spinach artichoke dip were 'just okay,' 'dry,' and 'not very cheesy.' Onion rings were 'just okay' with batter 'maybe even worse' than McDonald's chicken nuggets. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was 'dry and tasteless,' as was the bacon, which the reviewer sarcastically notes 'must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless.' They explicitly state they 'will definitely be staying away from the grub.'
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language for the atmosphere is very positive ('love,' 'hehehe,' 'fun,' 'fond of,' 'pretty badass'). However, the language for the food is extremely negative and intense ('disgusting,' 'dry and cold,' 'tasteless,' 'maybe even worse,' 'true talent'). The strong negative descriptors for the food are a major component.
5. **Would Recommend This Place:** The reviewer offers a conditional recommendation. They 'came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere,' indicating a recommendation for the experience. However, they 'will definitely be staying away from the grub,' which is a strong anti-recommendation for the food aspect, a core offering of a restaurant.
6. **Star Rating Justification:** While the atmosphere and unique drinks/desserts are significant positives and the reviewer plans to return for these, the description of the main food items as 'disgusting,' 'dry,' 'cold,' and 'tasteless' represents a fundamental failure for a dining establishment. The intensity of these complaints is too severe for a 3-star 'average' or 'okay' rating. A 1-star rating might be too harsh given the strong appreciation for the non-food elements and the reviewer's intent to return. Therefore, a 2-star rating accurately reflects a significant disappointment in a core area (food) alongside some redeeming qualities in other areas (atmosphere, specific novelty items), leading to a mixed but overall poor dining experience from a culinary perspective.","```json

"I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.",2,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, despite a few very minor concessions. The reviewer lists a litany of significant problems and concludes with a warning.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only truly positive aspect mentioned is that 'the grounds are clean.' The reviewer also notes that they give it 2 stars 'because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there,' which is a justification for not giving a lower score rather than a positive attribute of the property itself. The initial 'okay i guess' is very lukewarm.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Staff seems 'kinda disorganized,' got move-in dates wrong.
    *   Received a different apartment than originally shown.
    *   Linen closet has a 'big freakin heater tank' in it (space issue).
    *   Pays more for water because it's not divided equally.
    *   'EVERYTHING breaks': shower (twice), closet light (broke out wall), bathroom light (fell out wall), kitchen stove, washer – all broke since moving in.
    *   Feeling that 'my house is falling apart!'
    *   Office staff rushes them out, prevents them from finishing questions, which is 'really annoying.'
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language indicates high frustration: 'kinda disorganized,' 'FINALLY moved in,' 'big freakin heater tank,' 'EVERYTHING breaks,' 'my house is falling apart!', 'really annoying,' and the concluding warning 'So be careful.' The use of 'freakin' and 'EVERYTHING' (capitalized) highlights extreme annoyance and systemic issues.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The concluding statement, 'So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live,' is a clear and strong warning against renting here.
6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart!' This self-stated rating aligns with the analysis: a single positive (clean grounds) is heavily outweighed by numerous and severe negatives, including persistent maintenance failures, staff issues, and hidden costs. The problems are significant enough to warrant a 1-star rating, but the reviewer's personal assessment of 'worse apartments out there' elevates it slightly to a 2-star rating.","```json

"After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGR's that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.",2,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is decidedly negative. While acknowledging good service and one good appetizer, the reviewer uses strong negative language to describe the main meal and the table arrangement.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Service was 'very nice and attentive'.
    *   Staff was 'very patient' with party size changes (8 to 13 people).
    *   Saganaki appetizer was 'definitely good' and the pita bread was 'nice and warm'.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Dislike of the table arrangement ('I *hate* this', 'awkward', 'sucks').
    *   Gyro pita was 'definitely the worst one I've had' out of ten places.
    *   Gyro details: pita wasn't warm, meat was tough.
    *   Tzatziki placement was 'a little weird'.
    *   Implied negative about the restaurant not being crowded.
    *   The table decision 'knocks them down a little bit', but 'not as much as the not good gyro'.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The reviewer uses very strong negative language such as 'I *hate* this', 'sucks', 'lame decision', and 'definitely the worst one I've had'. This indicates a high level of dissatisfaction with the key elements of their dining experience.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Given the severe criticism of the main course and the dining setup, the reviewer would almost certainly not recommend this place for a full meal, especially a gyro.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The reviewer explicitly states their own rating thought process: 'Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.'

"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.

The reviewer expresses significant disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout the review.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are no positive aspects mentioned. The closest to neutral is ""Rest of the food was just okay,"" which is framed as a disappointment given expectations.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Guacamole: ""not very good at all"" (strong criticism)
    *   Salsa: ""not very good at all"" (strong criticism)

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is quite intense for a negative review. Phrases like ""not very good at all"" and ""expected so much better"" convey significant disappointment. The opening premise, ""I was right,"" confirms their initial negative prediction for the food. The closing comment about ""higher ratings from people of the Midwest"" implies their rating is deliberately lower due to their high standards.

Coupled with the high expectations for the location and the reviewer's self-admitted 'super critical' nature, the experience was clearly a significant letdown, falling far short of acceptable.

"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",2,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The review starts with 'Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait' and continues with intense criticism of almost every aspect of the experience.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:**
    *   The food aligns with their 'whole foods, plant-based eating habits' (conceptual positive, but execution failed).
    *   The air-fried egg was healthy and not greasy (though flavorless).
    *   The first Bloody Mary was 'flavorful' and 'extra spicy' as requested.
    *   Nourish has a 'nice patio' and 'view of the lush foliage'.
    *   These positives are very few and heavily outweighed.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   **Food Quality:** 'Bland and lackluster,' 'most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed,' 'downright disgusting,' 'mushy, flavorless heap,' 'worst breakfast item ever tasted,' 'granular texture equivalent to fine gravel,' 'strange taste,' 'off-putting texture,' vegetables 'ground up' with no discernible pieces. Even the second Bloody Mary was 'flavorless' and 'watered down.'
    *   **Service/Operations:** 'Incredibly long wait' (despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full), restaurant was 'out of bread' ('very poor planning by management'), 'incredibly long time to get' drinks.
    *   **Value:** 'not worth the price or the wait.'
    *   **Overall Experience:** 'tastebuds reeling in horror,' husband 'managed to choke down' food.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is exceptionally strong and negative throughout. Words like 'bland and lackluster,' 'not worth,' 'very poor planning,' 'incredibly long,' 'most flavorless I have ever consumed,' 'downright disgusting,' 'mushy, flavorless heap,' 'worst breakfast item ever tasted,' 'granular texture equivalent to fine gravel,' 'strange taste,' 'off-putting texture,' 'choke down,' and 'tastebuds reeling in horror' demonstrate extreme dissatisfaction.

5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states that the positive elements (patio, view) 'are not enough to bring us back.' This indicates a definitive non-recommendation and a complete unwillingness to return.

6. **Predicted Stars:** Given the overwhelming negativity, the severe and detailed complaints about food quality, slow service, operational issues, and the explicit statement that they will not return, this review clearly warrants the lowest possible rating. The minor positive points are completely overshadowed by the depth of dissatisfaction.","```json

"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.",2,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** Despite starting with a seemingly neutral or slightly positive tone and acknowledging some good aspects, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The concluding sentence, 'guarantee I will not return,' firmly establishes a very negative outlook.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Location (excellent)
    *   Interior décor (clean, modest, charming)
    *   Music (varied, pleasant mix)
    *   Service (friendly and quick)
    *   Menu offerings (plentiful and interesting, some vegetarian options)
    *   Carrying Boar's Head ingredients
    *   Greek salad (tasty, before the incident)
    *   Soup variety and daily soup appreciated
    *   Bread (deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, large)
    *   Cookies and brownies (4 stars on their own)
    *   Specific sandwiches (Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, Smokey Mountain) boast better flavor combinations
    *   Higher quality than Subway, Blimpie, etc.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Sandwich assembly/meat ratio (doesn't work, bulge in center, little/none at edges) - a recurring issue.
    *   Mexi wrap lacked flavor and tasted processed.
    *   **Dead fly in the Greek salad** (major hygiene issue).
    *   Soups not piping hot.
    *   New Red Bird menu item (not a fan).
    *   **Hair on pickle spear** (major hygiene issue).
    *   A bit pricier than competition.
    *   **Explicit statement of never returning.**

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language around the positive aspects is generally moderate ('excellent,' 'charming,' 'friendly,' 'plus,' 'deliciously soft'). However, the negative language intensifies significantly with 'simply doesn't work for me,' 'lacked flavor and tasted processed,' 'discovered a dead fly,' 'not a fan,' 'had a hair on it,' and, most critically, 'guarantee I will not return.' The incidents of the dead fly and hair are described in a factual but alarming way, and the final decision to never return is expressed with absolute certainty.

5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.' This is a definitive non-recommendation and a declaration of permanent avoidance.

6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While there are numerous positive observations, they are completely overshadowed by two severe hygiene violations (dead fly in food, hair on pickle spear) and a consistent complaint about sandwich assembly. The fact that this is a long-term customer who has given the place many chances, yet concludes with an absolute refusal to return, indicates a fundamental breakdown in trust and satisfaction. The hygiene issues alone are typically grounds for a 1-star rating, as they represent serious health concerns. The combination of these critical issues with ongoing food quality complaints (sandwich ratio, bland wrap, lukewarm soup) makes a 1-star rating appropriate.","```json

"Love the coffee not thrilled about my service. Of the 4-3 times I have been in the barista has never been behind the counter ready to serve me.  Every time that I have walked in they follow me off the patio where they have been smoking.  I know that you are entitled to a break but, sitting out chit chatting with your friends smoking is not what you get paid for.  Either I have bad timing coming in when they are on break or the kids there are huge slackers.",2,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is predominantly negative, despite a strong positive for the product itself. The reviewer dedicates the vast majority of the review to highly critical and frustrated observations about the service and staff behavior over multiple visits.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only positive aspect explicitly mentioned is ""Love the coffee."" This indicates a high satisfaction with the product itself.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The reviewer lists numerous negative points: not thrilled about the service, baristas never behind the counter (over 3-4 visits), baristas smoking on the patio and following customers in, baristas chit-chatting with friends instead of working, and a direct accusation of staff being ""huge slackers.""
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language ranges from mild ( ""not thrilled"") to very strong and accusatory (""never been behind the counter ready to serve me,"" ""not what you get paid for,"" ""huge slackers""). The repetition of the negative experience (""Of the 4-3 times I have been in,"" ""Every time"") significantly amplifies the intensity and frustration.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Despite loving the coffee, the consistent, deeply unprofessional service experience makes it highly unlikely the reviewer would recommend the *establishment* as a whole. They might recommend the coffee with severe caveats about the service, but the overall experience is clearly dissatisfying.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the ""love the coffee"" is a significant positive, the consistent, severe, and unprofessional service issues described with intense negative language overshadow it considerably. The reviewer's experience points to systemic problems with staff presence, professionalism, and work ethic. A 1-star rating is usually for entirely negative experiences, which isn't the case here due to the coffee. However, the service issues are far too egregious and consistent to warrant a 3-star (average/okay) or higher rating. The profound dissatisfaction with the service, despite the excellent coffee, places this squarely in the 'I didn't like it' category. Therefore, a 2-star rating is appropriate, acknowledging the good product while heavily penalizing the abysmal and consistently poor service.","```json

"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.",2,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. While it starts with a few positives, it quickly devolves into a lengthy list of significant complaints and disappointments.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:**
    *   Queso is 'ridiculously good'.
    *   Homemade tortillas are 'outstanding'.
    *   Chips and salsa set for the table were 'delicious'.
    *   Fajitas (chicken and veggie) were 'good and quite filling'.
    *   Veggies for fajitas were 'otherwise delicious' (despite not being grilled enough).
    *   Accompaniments for fajitas were 'decent'.
    *   The reviewer 'thoroughly enjoyed the food' on a *previous* visit, which is explicitly contrasted with the current experience.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   'Everything is average at best' aside from queso/tortillas.
    *   Cuisine is 'Americanized Mexican,' not 'autentica comida Mexicana.'
    *   Tortilla Soup: 'hilariously underwhelming,' described as 'kitchen scraps,' 'lousy,' and 'wouldn't recommend it.'
    *   Vegetable fajitas: veggies 'weren't grilled much.'
    *   Chicken fajitas: insufficient peppers (only one green, one red piece), not 'lush' as expected.
    *   Overall: 'fails on almost everything,' 'true shame,' 'so much potential, but it fails.'
    *   Service: 'really lousy.'
    *   Hygiene: Fiancee 'found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing.' The waitress's response was inadequate and defensive.
    *   Ambiance: Entry foyer 'smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.'

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The reviewer uses very strong negative language. Phrases like 'ridiculously good' and 'outstanding' for the positives are offset by 'average at best,' 'hilariously underwhelming,' 'kitchen scraps,' 'lousy' (used twice), 'sad,' 'fails on almost everything,' 'true shame,' 'very disappointing,' and 'foul.' The call for the restaurant to be on 'Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...' demonstrates extreme dissatisfaction. The bug incident is recounted with clear disgust and disappointment in the restaurant's handling.

5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future.' They also express doubt that their family and friends will return after the bug incident. This indicates a clear non-recommendation and a refusal to return.

6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Despite a few initial positives (queso, tortillas), the sheer volume, severity, and nature of the negative points are overwhelming. The 'lousy' service, the 'foul' smell, the 'hilariously underwhelming' soup, and most critically, the *bug found in the water* with an inadequate response, push this review firmly into the lowest possible star rating. The reviewer's strong statement about not returning and the comparison to 'Restaurant Impossible' solidify a complete failure of the dining experience, overshadowing any minor positives.

"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.

Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.",2,2,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The review presents a mixed bag, but the concluding statement, ""I was not impressed,"" clearly signals a negative overall sentiment, despite some positive individual aspects.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects/Complaints:** The green sauce was described as ""so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor."" The beans and rice were also ""disappointing."" The reviewer also mentioned a general lack of impression, even allowing for potential unfamiliarity with the cuisine.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language is moderate-to-strong (""mmm"" for chips, ""tender"" for chicken). However, the negative language for the green sauce is very strong (""so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it""), indicating a significant failure for that dish component. ""Disappointing"" for beans and rice is moderate, and ""not impressed"" is a definitive, albeit polite, negative conclusion.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Given the overall ""not impressed"" feeling, combined with significant issues with core menu items (green sauce, sides), it's highly unlikely the reviewer would recommend this place, or would do so only with heavy caveats that might deter potential customers.
6. **Rating Assignment (1-5 stars):** While there were specific positives (chips, red salsa, chicken, service), the intensity of the negative experience with the green sauce (rendering it inedible without heavy modification) and the disappointing sides, coupled with the overarching ""not impressed"" sentiment, drags the rating down considerably. On Yelp's scale, 3 stars is ""OK - It was alright,"" and 2 stars is ""Didn't like it."" The sentiment ""not impressed"" leans more towards ""Didn't like it"" because it implies the experience fell below expectations and was not simply 'alright.'

6. **Star Rating Justification:** While the setting and service were good, the fundamental failure in food quality (average at best, overcooked) and value for money is a critical flaw for a restaurant. The explicit statement that the positives ""don't make up for"" these negatives pushes the rating below a neutral 3-star.

"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.",2,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly very negative. Words like 'disappointed,' 'wasn't that good,' and the definitive statement 'I won't be back' leave no room for positive interpretation.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are absolutely no positive aspects mentioned in the review.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects:** The reviewer was disappointed with the chicken's preparation (not chunks, but a sliced fried piece) and found the sauce wasn't good. These are two distinct and significant complaints about the food itself.
4. **Intensity of Language:** The language is quite intense. 'Disappointed' conveys strong negative emotion. 'Wasn't that good anyway' is dismissive and reinforces the negative experience. The concluding remark, 'I won't be back,' is a very strong and final declaration of dissatisfaction, indicating a complete refusal to return to the establishment.
5. **Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'I won't be back,' which unequivocally means they would not recommend this place, at least not based on this experience.
6. **Assigned Rating:** Given the complete absence of positive feedback, multiple specific complaints about the food, strong negative emotional language, and a definitive statement of non-return, the review points to the lowest possible rating.

"I happened on this place because it was next to EL Brava, a Mexican place recommended by the USAirways in flight magazine as a place to try in an airport. Getting to ElBrava we found it was a fast food stand with very little seating so this is next door. 

The menu was pretty limited. Service actually wasn't bad but, even though it wasn't busy, we waited a long, long time for our meal to get there.... something you don't expect in an airport. When the food got there it ok. I had a burger that was pricey and non memorable. 

Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!",2,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is very negative. The reviewer clearly expresses disappointment and frustration with multiple aspects of their experience.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only slightly positive aspect mentioned is that ""Service actually wasn't bad."" However, this is immediately followed by a major complaint about wait time, which heavily outweighs this minor positive.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Limited menu.
    *   Very long wait time for the meal, especially for an airport setting.
    *   Food was only ""ok.""
    *   Burger was pricey.
    *   Burger was ""non memorable.""
    *   The initial reason for visiting (El Brava being a letdown) suggests they settled for this place, and it still disappointed.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite intense, particularly: ""long, long time,"" ""something you don't expect in an airport,"" ""pricey and non memorable,"" and the definitive closing statement, ""Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!"" This last phrase strongly conveys a complete rejection of the establishment.
5. **Determination of recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states, ""Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!"" This is a clear and strong statement that they would absolutely *not* recommend this place and would actively avoid it in the future, even preferring a place they initially found disappointing (El Brava).

"The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one? 

The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times.

The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?

There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.


12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our ""snack"" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)",2,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses deep dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of their experience over several visits, despite a general fondness for the Starbucks brand.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only 'positive' mentioned is the reviewer's general love for the Starbucks brand ('The kids and I LOVE Starbucks'), but this is immediately contrasted with the poor experience at *this specific location*. The update mentions 'wanted to say things were better today,' indicating a *potential* for improvement, but explicitly states, 'I am not going to change my my rating until after my next visit,' which means the previous negative sentiment (and implied low rating) still stands.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   'leaves a lot to be desired'
    *   Repeated questioning of why they return ('why do I go back to this one?')
    *   Service is 'almost rude'
    *   Staff seem 'annoyed to be busy' and 'never seem to be happy to service you'
    *   Drinks 'take forever to make' even when not busy

    *   'Main issue': 3 out of 5 times, staff sweep the floor near them while they are sitting and relaxing
    *   Explicitly states there are 'much better Starbucks' and intends to try others locally.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite strong and expresses significant frustration: 'almost rude,' 'annoyed to be busy,' 'never seem to be happy,' 'take forever,' 'messed up the last 2 times,' 'Really? While I am sitting there?'. The phrase 'leaves a lot to be desired' is understated given the preceding complaints, making the overall impression even more negative. The follow-up stating they won't change the rating until a future visit confirms the current rating is low.

6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the multitude of severe and repeated issues (rude service, slow service, incorrect orders, disruptive cleaning practices) and the explicit statement of seeking other locations, the initial implied rating is a 1-star. The update, while noting a slightly better recent visit, explicitly states the rating will *not* be changed until the *next* visit, reinforcing that the deep dissatisfaction from previous visits still dictates the rating.","```json

"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy!

""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they don't have to be greedy about it!",2,1,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Overall sentiment:** Very negative. The reviewer uses strong, indignant language throughout, expressing extreme dissatisfaction with both pricing and food quality.

2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** None. The reviewer acknowledges the 'prime location' but immediately uses it to justify their criticism of pricing, not as a positive attribute of the establishment itself.

3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Exorbitant beer prices ($4.50 for domestic, $5.50 for Corona) especially during 'happy hour' and compared to grocery store prices.
    *   Slams the 'World Famous Sliders' as the 'worst sliders ever,' claiming fast-food sliders (Jack in the Box) are better.
    *   Sliders were overpriced (almost $10 for six).
    *   Slider patties were tiny ('size of a half dollar') and lost in the bun.
    *   Sliders had minimal toppings (one jalapeno, small cheese square).
    *   Salsa made the slider buns soggy.
    *   Accusation of the establishment being 'greedy' despite their prime location and guaranteed revenue.

4.  **Intensity of language used:** Very high. Phrases like 'Are you serious?', 'Cra-zy!', 'worst sliders ever', 'greedy', and comparisons to fast food for worse quality, coupled with multiple exclamation marks, convey intense anger, disbelief, and disappointment.

5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The entire review is a scathing denouncement of the establishment, serving as a clear warning to potential customers.

6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the complete absence of any positive remarks, the multitude of severe complaints regarding both value and quality, and the highly intense negative language, a 1-star rating is the only appropriate prediction.","```json

1.  **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, starting with ""Not good"" and ending with ""Just disappointing."" Every food item mentioned receives strong criticism.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only positive mention is that ""The service was decent though."" This is a very mild positive and is immediately overshadowed by severe food criticisms. ""Fresh rolls large"" is a neutral observation about size, quickly followed by a negative about flavor.
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   ""Not good.""
    *   ""Very bland Thai food""
    *   ""bland and Thai!"" (emphatically stating this is a major failure for Thai cuisine)

    *   ""Fresh rolls... no flavor.""
    *   ""Just disappointing.""
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and negative.

"The ""chicken burger"" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich.",2,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only 'saving grace' mentioned is that the sandwich was small, which is framed as a positive because it meant there was less of the bad food to eat. This is not a true positive about the food itself.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The sandwich was described as 'gross,' 'dried out,' and having 'terrible flavor.' The reviewer also notes the disappointment of receiving a ground chicken patty instead of a grilled chicken breast, although they acknowledge this was partly their misunderstanding. The sandwich is explicitly called 'terrible' twice.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and negative ('gross,' 'dried out,' 'terrible flavor,' 'terrible sandwich'). The phrase 'The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there' is particularly damning and sarcastic, indicating extreme dissatisfaction.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The review offers no redeeming qualities for the food experienced and uses language that strongly discourages others from trying it.

"Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated ""Thai hot"" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.",3,2,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is predominantly negative, especially regarding the taste of the food, despite some positive points about the ambiance and freshness of ingredients.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Enjoyed dinner on the patio (general statement).
    *   Patio ambiance was enjoyable.
    *   Ginger fish looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.
    *   Seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in the Pad Cha dish was very fresh.
    *   Thai iced tea was very tasty (initially).
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Pad Cha Seafood dish was not 'Thai hot' at all, despite being advertised as the hottest.
    *   Ginger fish was 'mediocre at best'.
    *   General complaint: 'dishes looked better than they actually tasted'.
    *   Thai iced tea was 'a little too sweet towards the end'.
    *   Overall summary: 'wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food'.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The negative language is quite strong: 'mediocre at best' is dismissive, 'wasn't Thai hot at all' expresses clear disappointment, and 'wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food' is a definitive negative judgment on the core offering. The positive language is milder ('enjoyed,' 'enjoyable,' 'very fresh,' 'very tasty').
5. **Would Recommend:** The reviewer states, 'Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future'. This indicates a hesitant willingness to return, suggesting the experience wasn't a complete disaster but also wasn't good enough for a strong recommendation. It mitigates a 1-star rating but doesn't elevate it significantly.
6. **Star Rating Conclusion:** While there are a few positives (ambiance, fresh ingredients, visual appeal), the core function of a restaurant – the taste of the food – was a significant letdown, described as 'mediocre at best' and 'looked better than they actually tasted,' culminating in 'wasn't very impressed'. The failure to deliver on the promised spice level is also a key disappointment. The willingness to 'probably give another try' suggests hope for improvement rather than satisfaction with the current visit. Therefore, a 2-star rating is appropriate, acknowledging some good points but strongly reflecting overall disappointment with the most critical aspect: the food's taste.","```json

"I really want to gives this Sprout's location 4 stars but over the past few months when I get a deli sandwich the bread has bean stale 1 out of 3 times I'm there so I can't do it. If this Sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread I'd be happy.

On to the rest of the store....
Sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.",3,3,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is mixed. The reviewer expresses a strong desire to give 4 stars, indicating a generally positive view of the store, but a specific, recurring issue with deli bread prevents them from doing so. The rest of the store is described very positively.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer calls Sprout's a 'great farmer's market' with a 'great selection of produce,' 'great meats, seafood and cheeses.' The initial statement 'I really want to give this Sprout's location 4 stars' also indicates a strong underlying positive sentiment for most of their experience.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaint is that the deli sandwich bread has been stale '1 out of 3 times' over 'the past few months.' This indicates a recurring and persistent problem, not a one-off incident. This issue is explicitly stated as the reason for not giving 4 stars.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The positive language is strong ('really want to,' 'great farmer's market,' 'great selection,' 'great meats'). The negative language, while not overtly emotional, is firm ('stale,' 'I can't do it'). The frequency and duration of the stale bread issue ('1 out of 3 times,' 'past few months') add weight to the complaint, indicating it's a significant and frustrating problem for the reviewer.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer implies a conditional recommendation. They clearly value the store for its produce, meats, seafood, and cheeses. They want the deli issue fixed ('If this Sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread I'd be happy'), suggesting they would continue to shop there, perhaps just avoiding the deli or hoping for improvement. This is not a 'do not recommend' scenario, but rather a 'recommend with a major caveat' situation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The review perfectly balances significant positives with a critical, recurring negative. The desire to give 4 stars is directly counteracted by the stale bread problem. A 4-star rating is not possible due to the explicit complaint. A 2-star rating would imply a generally poor experience, which is contradicted by the 'great' descriptions of most of the store. A 1-star rating is clearly out of the question. Therefore, 3 stars ('Average' or 'Okay') is the most appropriate rating, acknowledging the good aspects while penalizing for the significant and consistent flaw that prevents a higher score.","```json

Keep perservering...maybe I'll write another review when something outrageous happens :)",3,3,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is neutral. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either.'
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only specific positive mentioned is that the staff (stockers, cleaners, counter staff) have all been 'polite so far.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The reviewer states, 'I have nothing really bad to say,' indicating no specific complaints or negative aspects.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite mild and understated. 'Polite so far' is a moderate positive. The phrase 'nothing really bad... nothing really great' is very direct and balanced. 'Keep persevering' is a mild encouragement, and the sarcastic/playful 'something outrageous happens :)' reinforces the idea that the current experience is unremarkable.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer would likely give a lukewarm recommendation. They wouldn't actively discourage others from going, as there's nothing 'bad,' but they also wouldn't strongly recommend it since nothing was 'great' or stood out. It's an 'it's fine' type of recommendation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** A 3-star rating perfectly aligns with this review. On Yelp, 3 stars typically means 'Average' or 'Okay.'

"I'm somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp ""Talk"" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I won't be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco)

First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They weren't busy. 

We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!

But, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!",3,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The reviewer explicitly states they are 'somewhere in between three and four stars' in the very first sentence, indicating a mixed but leaning towards positive experience. While there are clear complaints, the general tone is appreciative of certain aspects, making it neutral-to-positive overall.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Cute, compartmentalized rooms
    *   Homey feel
    *   Good selection of beer
    *   Well made cocktails
    *   Patio seats, 'rocking good!'
    *   The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, 'perfect.'
    *   People watching, 'phenomenal.'
    *   Fish and Chips, 'pretty good.'
    *   The friends shared the experience with, 'too good to be true!' (contributes to overall positive experience, even if not about the venue itself).
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Had to approach the bar for service, refills, and a check (even though not busy).
    *   Expected 'something earth shattering' given the location near Pizzeria Bianco (implied unmet expectation).
    *   Good wine, 'no.'
    *   Menu, 'eh, okay' (neutral to slightly negative).
    *   Service, 'eh, poor to okay' (a significant complaint).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:**
    *   The opening is humorous and self-deprecating ('won't be egged').
    *   Strong positive language for ambiance: 'rocking good' (patio), 'perfect' (trees), 'phenomenal' (people watching).
    *   Strong negative for wine: 'no'.
    *   Mildly negative/indifferent for menu and service: 'eh, okay' and 'eh, poor to okay'.
    *   The service complaint about having to approach the bar is a clear, factual criticism, but not delivered with outrage.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, implicitly. The reviewer suggests using the Rose and Crown (or Bar Bianco) as a pleasant alternative to waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco ('Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!'). This indicates a recommendation for the patio and pre-dinner drinks experience.
6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The reviewer explicitly states being 'somewhere in between three and four stars.' While service was a significant detractor ('poor to okay') and wine was a definite 'no,' the numerous and strongly worded positives for the ambiance, patio, specific drinks (beer, cocktails), and the overall experience (people watching, fish & chips, friends) create a strong counter-balance. The implied recommendation to use the patio as a pleasant alternative also leans towards a positive overall experience. Given the explicit 'between three and four' and the strong positives, rounding up to a 4 seems appropriate, indicating 'Good, I recommend it with some caveats,' rather than a 3 which would be 'Okay, I might or might not return.'","```json

"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.

The reviewer also explicitly states they are 'understanding' and that the bug was 'not necessarily their fault,' significantly mitigating the negative impact.
2. **Specific positive aspects:** The manager's quick apology, taking the dessert off the bill, and offering another. The 'rest of the meal was great,' specifically mentioning 'scallops with green beans and capers' as 'yummy.' The reviewer's general liking for Pappadeaux's and noting this as the 'first time I didn't have a great experience' implies many previous positive experiences.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** A flying bug landed in the dessert, died, and was found while eating, which 'grossed me out.'
4. **Intensity of language used:** High intensity on both sides. 'Grossed me out' is strong negative language. 'Yummy!' and 'great' are strong positive descriptors. However, the reviewer's active effort to be 'understanding' and stating the bug was 'not necessarily their fault' softens the negative impact and indicates a willingness to overlook the incident.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, strongly. The statement 'I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience' indicates continued loyalty and a belief that this was an anomaly, not a systemic problem. The positive resolution by management also contributes to this.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While a bug in food is a serious issue that could easily warrant 1 or 2 stars, several factors elevate the rating significantly. The excellent service recovery by the manager, the fact that the *rest* of the meal was explicitly called 'great' and 'yummy,' and the reviewer's clear understanding and loyalty to the restaurant ('not necessarily their fault,' 'first time I didn't have a great experience') indicate that this single incident, while unpleasant, did not ruin the overall experience to a degree that would warrant a very low rating.

It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.",3,3,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The immediate experience described is overwhelmingly negative, detailing an unprofessional and possibly impaired staff member that led to no purchases. However, the overall sentiment towards the establishment itself is tempered by previous acceptable experiences and appreciation for its charm, leading to a complex sentiment that isn't purely negative.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer explicitly states: ""I've been before, and thought their stuff was good, not great."" and ""Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that."" They also imply that it's an acceptable option ""until something better comes along.""
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaint is about a specific staff member who was described as ""on something pretty heavy,"" ""so blitzed out of her mind,"" ""barely able to interact,"" asking the same question repeatedly, avoiding eye contact, looking ""filthy,"" and being ""really rude."" This interaction was so negative that ""no one in the party decided to order anything."" The reviewer also criticizes the hiring practices, suggesting they need to do a ""better job at hiring their staff.""
4. **Intensity of language used:** The negative language is very intense and vivid (e.g., ""blitzed out of her mind,"" ""pretty filthy,"" ""really rude,"" ""turned us off so bad""), indicating extreme displeasure with the service. The positive language is also quite strong for the ambiance (""pretty damn adorable"") but less enthusiastic for the product (""good, not great"").
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer does not strongly recommend the place, stating ""for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do."" This suggests a reluctant acceptance rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The reviewer explicitly states, ""I give it 3 stars."" This aligns with the analysis: an extremely negative recent service experience (which would typically warrant 1-2 stars) is mitigated by previous satisfactory product quality and strong positive feelings about the establishment's charm and local nature. The balance between the terrible recent service, the redeeming qualities of the place, and the previous 'good, not great' product experience results in a neutral-to-average rating of 3 stars.","```json

"I am not happy with Sprinkles, but I can't really subtract stars because I make better cupcakes than they do.  Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need ""personality"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.

As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.

The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.

Sprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.",3,1,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am not happy with Sprinkles' and concludes with 'I will not be back. I don't like you.' Throughout the review, strong negative feelings are expressed about the location, the general concept of chains, and, most importantly, the quality of the cupcakes.
2.  **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are very few positive aspects. The reviewer liked the texture of the chocolate frosting on the peanut butter chocolate cupcake and loved the chocolate jimmies covering it. A faint 'at least I could still eat it' was mentioned after a significant negative incident. No other genuine positives were noted.
3.  **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Location: Described as 'very stupid,' 'easy to miss,' 'blends in,' and having 'No personality.'
    *   General: Disdain for Scottsdale and chains, though the reviewer acknowledges these shouldn't subtract stars.
    *   Red Velvet Cupcake: 'really only okay,' 'very plain,' lacked cocoa and buttermilk flavor, 'just tasted red and cake.' The cupcake crown 'popped off' which 'pissed me off' and 'ruined my first bite.' The cream cheese frosting was 'so-so,' 'barely tangy,' 'super sweet,' 'slightly grainy,' and had a 'crust on the top from sitting out too long.' Overall 'kind of meh.'
    *   Peanut Butter Chocolate Cupcake: 'definitely not what I had hoped for.' The cake was 'dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.' It was 'just okay as is.'
    *   Explicitly states: 'I am not happy with Sprinkles,' 'I will not be back,' 'I don't like you.'
4.  **Intensity of Language:** The language used is quite intense for the negative points. Words like 'very stupid,' 'pissed me off,' 'ruined my first bite,' 'I hate Scottsdale,' and 'I don't like you' convey strong dissatisfaction. The repeated use of 'okay' and 'meh' for the product itself, combined with the other strong negatives, indicates profound disappointment.
5.  **Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Sprinkles, I will not be back. I don't like you.' This is a clear non-recommendation.
6.  **Star Rating:** Despite the reviewer's self-correction about not subtracting stars for personal biases (like hating Scottsdale or making better cupcakes), the actual product review is overwhelmingly negative and detailed in its complaints. Both cupcakes were severely critiqued on flavor, texture, and presentation (the crown popping off). The strong emotional language ('pissed me off,' 'ruined my first bite') combined with the explicit statement of not returning and not liking the establishment points to the lowest possible rating. The very minor positive points (frosting texture, jimmies) are completely overshadowed by the significant and numerous complaints about the core product and overall experience.","```json

"* 5 stars for uniqueness - This place has very interesting food and flavors that aren't common around here.

* 5 stars for the staff - Everybody was very fast and friendly.

* 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - I mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100-year-old house in a cool part of downtown Phoenix.  Parking is a pain though.

However.....

Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.",3,2,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Overall sentiment:** The review starts with seemingly high praise for specific attributes (""5 stars for uniqueness,"" ""5 stars for the staff,"" ""5 stars for coolness""), but the sentiment dramatically shifts with the word ""However....."". The concluding paragraph expresses strong dissatisfaction regarding value and satiety, making the overall sentiment negative concerning the core dining experience.

2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Unique food and flavors that are uncommon.
    *   Fast and friendly staff.
    *   Cool location and establishment (redone 100-year-old house in a trendy part of downtown Phoenix).
    *   Hip, cool, urban, and trendy atmosphere.

3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Parking is a pain.
    *   Felt hungry after leaving.
    *   Felt ""ripped off.""
    *   Very expensive ($100+ per person) for tapas, especially to feel full.
    *   Not suitable for a full dinner; recommended only as a pre-dinner stop.

4.  **Intensity of language used:**
    *   **Positive language:** ""very interesting,"" ""fast and friendly,"" ""pretty cool,"" ""hip, cool, urban and trendy."" These are moderately strong positives.
    *   **Negative language:** ""pain though"" (for parking, moderate), ""hungry and ripped off"" (very strong, emotional, and critical of a restaurant's core function), ""would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person"" (emphatic rejection of value). The negative language, especially ""ripped off"" and ""hungry,"" is far more intense and impactful than the positive descriptors.

5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer offers a highly conditional and limited recommendation: ""more of a fun/interesting place to go *before* you go out to dinner."" This implies a strong negative recommendation for it as a standalone dining destination, suggesting it fails to fulfill the primary purpose of a restaurant for the price.

6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the reviewer acknowledges several positive aspects (staff, atmosphere, uniqueness), these are severely outweighed by the fundamental failures of a restaurant experience: feeling ""hungry"" and ""ripped off"" due to high prices for insufficient portions. The emphatic 'However' section and the very specific, limited recommendation to go *before* dinner indicate a significant disappointment with the value and dining satisfaction. The intense negative language like ""ripped off"" pushes it far below an average (3-star) rating. However, the positive notes on staff and ambiance prevent it from being a 1-star (terrible) review. A 2-star rating accurately reflects a place with some redeeming qualities but significant, core flaws that make for a largely unsatisfactory experience for the price.","```json

"I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. 

Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.

Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. 
Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. 
Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. 

If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.",3,1,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer starts by stating a past love for the place that has significantly diminished, and then proceeds to list a series of severe complaints.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are no specific positive aspects mentioned. The observation 'Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us' is a neutral logistical point, not a compliment to the establishment.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The review is filled with negative points:
    *   **Poor Service:** The waitress was described as 'on something,' 'out of it,' forgot their order twice, and couldn't remember taking it.
    *   **Unsafe/Chaotic Atmosphere:** A person at the next table fell out of their chair, and 'no one really even seemed to notice,' suggesting a chaotic and possibly unsafe environment where such incidents might be common.
    *   **Decline in Appearance/Maintenance:** The place looks 'tired, worn out,' especially the fabric on chairs and booths, contrasting sharply with its 'spotless, and shiny' past. The staff is also described as 'tattered.'
    *   **Undesirable Crowd:** The crowd is characterized as 'Very young, very drunk,' resembling a 'spring break crowd,' making people 'over 28' feel old.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly intense and critical. Phrases like 'Waitress was on something,' 'Very bizarre,' 'No one really even seemed to notice,' 'tired, worn out,' 'tattered,' and 'Very young, very drunk' convey strong disapproval, disbelief, and disgust. The comparison to its former 'spotless and shiny' state further amplifies the sense of decline.
5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer would absolutely not recommend this place. The entire review details a string of negative experiences and observations, culminating in a clear statement that certain demographics (over 28) would 'feel old,' implying it's not a suitable place for them, and by extension, not generally recommended.
6. **Predicted Star Rating:** Given the complete absence of positive aspects, the numerous severe complaints covering service, safety, atmosphere, cleanliness, and crowd, and the strong, negative language used throughout, a 1-star rating is warranted. The experience seems to have been profoundly disappointing and problematic on multiple fronts.","```json

I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.,3,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is strongly negative. While there are a couple of positive points about the food, these are heavily outweighed by significant complaints about service, atmosphere, and specific food items, culminating in an explicit declaration of not returning.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer was seated right away. They enjoyed the rice and chicken dishes, and the bread was really good.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The reviewer waited 10 minutes without service, watching workers walk around. They were bothered by the owner's child sitting with customers and then crying, expressing shock and strongly stating that kids should be left at home if not working. They had to ask staff for the buffet. The fish dishes were 'not so good,' with fish puffs being cold and not good, and one fish dish having a 'super fishy taste.'
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite intense, especially regarding the child ('it just does not need to happen,' 'kind of shocked,' 'please leave your kids at home'). The 'good 10 minutes' waiting indicates significant annoyance. 'Cold and not good' and 'super fishy tasteing' are direct and strong criticisms of the food. The concluding 'will not be going back anytime soon' and 'nothing to write home about' are definitive negative statements.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about,' which is a clear disrecommendation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The positive aspects are minor (quick seating, specific food items) compared to the numerous and intensely negative complaints about service, atmosphere (the child issue), and specific food quality. The strong negative conclusion and explicit disrecommendation rule out 3 stars or higher. While there were some edible items preventing a 1-star (which is usually reserved for disastrous experiences with no redeeming qualities), the combination of poor service, significant discomfort from the child issue, and specific food quality failures strongly points to a 2-star rating.

"Buffet is great, Good Selection of food even for me the picky Vegetarian. Naan tastes great, choice of plain or Garlic Naan. Food generally tastes good. Rating on Buffet alone, I would have given 4 stars.

However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.

Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those) 

The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.

Good place for the lunch buffet.",3,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is mixed but leans negative. While the buffet receives strong praise, the reviewer explicitly states they might not return for dinner or take-out due to significant issues and even assigns an explicit '1 star' for a recent take-out experience.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The buffet is described as 'great,' with a 'Good Selection of food' for a picky vegetarian. Naan 'tastes great,' and 'Food generally tastes good' (likely referring to the buffet). The reviewer would give the buffet 4 stars alone and calls it a 'Good place for the lunch buffet.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The reviewer 'might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.' Dinner entries are considered 'priced well above $10' and use 'frozen vegetables' (specifically 'Crinkle cut carrots' which the reviewer 'hate[s]'). For take-out, the quantity was 'about half' of a previous order, the food tasted 'sub-par,' and the naan was 'burnt.' The reviewer explicitly states, 'For this they get only 1 star' for the take-out experience.
4. **Intensity of language used:** Positive language includes 'great,' 'good selection.' Negative language is quite intense: 'might not return,' 'god I hate those' (referring to frozen vegetables), 'about half' (indicating a significant reduction in quantity), 'sub-par,' and 'burnt.' The explicit assignment of 'only 1 star' for take-out is a very strong negative indicator.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly recommends the place *only* for the lunch buffet and states they 'might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.' This indicates a highly conditional, limited recommendation for one specific service, and a clear non-recommendation for others.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the buffet experience is positive (rated 4 stars by the reviewer if considered alone), the severe negative experiences with dinner (price, frozen vegetables, strong dislike) and especially take-out (explicitly rated 1 star, with issues like quantity, taste, and burnt food) drag the overall rating down significantly. The reviewer's strong declaration of not returning for dinner or take-out, coupled with the explicit 1-star rating for a significant service, indicates a poor overall impression of the restaurant beyond its buffet. A 2-star rating reflects that there is one good aspect, but the overall experience across other core services is problematic and inconsistent, leading to a general non-recommendation for the establishment as a whole outside of the buffet.","```json

While the buffet receives strong praise, the reviewer explicitly states they might not return for dinner or take-out due to significant issues and even assigns an explicit '1 star' for a recent take-out experience.\n2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The buffet is described as 'great,' with a 'Good Selection of food' for a picky vegetarian. Naan 'tastes great,' and 'Food generally tastes good' (likely referring to the buffet). The reviewer would give the buffet 4 stars alone and calls it a 'Good place for the lunch buffet.'\n3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The reviewer 'might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.' Dinner entries are considered 'priced well above $10' and use 'frozen vegetables' (specifically 'Crinkle cut carrots' which the reviewer 'hate[s]'). For take-out, the quantity was 'about half' of a previous order, the food tasted 'sub-par,' and the naan was 'burnt.' The reviewer explicitly states, 'For this they get only 1 star' for the take-out experience.\n4. **Intensity of language used:** Positive language includes 'great,' 'good selection.' Negative language is quite intense: 'might not return,' 'god I hate those' (referring to frozen vegetables), 'about half' (indicating a significant reduction in quantity), 'sub-par,' and 'burnt.' The explicit assignment of 'only 1 star' for take-out is a very strong negative indicator.\n5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly recommends the place *only* for the lunch buffet and states they 'might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.' This indicates a highly conditional, limited recommendation for one specific service, and a clear non-recommendation for others.\n6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the buffet experience is positive (rated 4 stars by the reviewer if considered alone), the severe negative experiences with dinner (price, frozen vegetables, strong dislike) and especially take-out (explicitly rated 1 star, with issues like quantity, taste, and burnt food) drag the overall rating down significantly. The reviewer's strong declaration of not returning for dinner or take-out, coupled with the explicit 1-star rating for a significant service, indicates a poor overall impression of the restaurant beyond its buffet. A 2-star rating reflects that there is one good aspect, but the overall experience across other core services is problematic and inconsistent, leading to a general non-recommendation for the establishment as a whole outside of the buffet.""

"Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars. 
My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Morton's and Mastro's) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durant's had great reviews. 
When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then you're greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere.
Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.",3,3,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards slightly negative due to the critical assessment of the food, especially the main dish (steak), which was their primary reason for visiting. While service and ambiance received high praise, the fundamental disappointment with the cuisine, particularly for their stated preference (steaks), pulls the overall experience down.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Service: Rated 5 stars, described as 'so rare', every staff member greeted them, waiter Fred was 'awesome!! Very friendly and professional'.
    *   Ambiance/Experience: Walking through the kitchen was 'pretty cool', decor was 'pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, deep red walls, huge vases of roses everywhere'.
    *   Food (minor positives): Vegetable beef soup was 'good' (despite being salty), and the trio creme brulee was 'the best part of the meal!'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Food: Overall rated 2.5 stars.
    *   Vegetable beef soup: 'good but salty'.
    *   Trout with lemon caper sauce: 'very bland'.
    *   Rib-eye: 'also bland which was surprising' (critical, as they are picky steak eaters).
    *   Conclusion: 'So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.' This is a strong negative statement regarding the restaurant's core offering for them.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:**
    *   Positive language is strong for service ('5 stars', 'so rare', 'awesome!!'). Ambiance is 'pretty cool'. Dessert is 'the best part'.
    *   Negative language for food is direct and impactful: 'salty', 'very bland', 'also bland which was surprising'. The concluding sentence is definitive and expresses clear disappointment for their primary goal.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.' This indicates they would NOT recommend Durant's for its primary purpose as a steakhouse to other steak connoisseurs, which was their own reason for visiting. While they might enjoy the service/ambiance, the core product failed them.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The review presents a clear dichotomy: excellent service and ambiance (5 stars) versus disappointing food, especially the steak (2.5 stars). Since the primary goal of their visit was for steak, and they are 'picky' steak eaters accustomed to high-end steakhouses, the failure of the steak to impress is a significant detractor. The concluding statement that they would stick to their usual places for steak is a strong indicator of overall dissatisfaction despite the great service. A 3-star rating reflects a 'mixed bag' experience – not terrible due to the positives, but not good enough due to the critical failure of the main courses for their specific expectations. It's an average experience for them, not one they'd repeat for the core offering.","```json

"what better way to end a perfect Spring training baseball day than with a marg, Mexican food and your girlfriends...
the local in the group said this place would be crowded on a Sat night, so we weren't surprised with the wait time, but if a place is used to being crowded....they should have a better wait plan. if the bar is full (which it was for a bit), there is not much space to hang and wait, once we got to our table, our waitress spaced....got us water and then never came back. i liked the menu, as it spiced up some of the normal Mexican fare...like the shrimp chilaquiles with chipotle cream sauce that was great! the guac is good, but deceiving as it comes out in this huge mound served in a pestle...in actuality, there is a lot of lettuce on bottom then cup of guac. and my house margarita was more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.

i think this place has potential and i might try it again if i could do it on a weeknight, but for now it just gets my average.",3,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is negative, despite a positive opening setup and one positive food item. The reviewer highlights significant operational, service, and product quality issues.
2. **Positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer enjoyed the 'spiced up' menu concept, specifically liked the 'shrimp chilaquiles with chipotle cream sauce that was great!', and found the guacamole 'good' (though immediately qualified negatively). They also stated the place has 'potential' and 'might try it again if I could do it on a weeknight.'
3. **Negative aspects or complaints:** Significant complaints include a poor wait plan for a crowded place with inadequate waiting space, a completely absent waitress who 'spaced' and 'never came back' after getting water (a major service failure), 'deceiving' guacamole presentation with lots of lettuce under a small cup of guac, and a 'house margarita' that was 'more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.'
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language indicates frustration and disappointment. Words like 'should have a better wait plan,' 'waitress spaced... never came back,' 'deceiving,' and 'kinda ick' convey strong negative feelings. The concluding remark 'for now it just gets my average' is used in a tone that suggests dissatisfaction rather than neutral acceptance.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer offers a highly conditional non-recommendation. They explicitly state 'for now it just gets my average' and only 'might try it again if I could do it on a weeknight.' This implies a clear non-recommendation for a busy Saturday night, which was their experience.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating:** While the reviewer explicitly uses the word 'average,' the *details* of their experience paint a picture of significant failures. A completely absent waitress is a critical service flaw, the deceptive guac is a trust issue, and the 'ick' margarita detracts from a key offering. These are beyond minor inconveniences. A 3-star rating typically indicates an 'okay' experience with some good and some bad, but generally acceptable. The experience described here, with major service failures and deceptive practices, is more indicative of a 'poor' or 2-star rating, where significant issues detract heavily from the overall enjoyment, even if one dish was good. The 'potential' comment prevents it from being a 1-star, but the actual experience documented is predominantly negative and frustrating.","```json

The final rhetorical question indicates significant frustration.
2. **Positive aspects mentioned:** ""Great food"" is a clear and strong positive.
3. **Negative aspects or complaints:** ""bad service"" is a direct negative. ""Does anyone speak english in here?"" is a highly frustrated complaint about a perceived communication barrier, suggesting a significant breakdown in the customer experience beyond just typical 'bad service.'

The overall experience appears to be heavily marred by the negatives.
6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the food was 'great,' the service was 'bad' and compounded by a very frustrating communication issue. This combination prevents a higher rating.

"Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :) 

you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy... 

they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,, 

Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service... 

every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it... 

everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything... 

the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done... 

the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol 

over all 
The atmosphere was amazing..... 
the staff was fabulous... 
the food... eh... 
the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?! 
and its kinda on the pricey side... 

i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to... 
there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?",3,2,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment starts moderately positive regarding location and atmosphere, but progressively introduces significant negative aspects concerning the menu, pricing, and several food items, culminating in strong criticism and a weak non-recommendation.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Easy to find location with good parking.
    *   Atmosphere is described with highly positive words: 'wow,' 'completely different,' 'calming,' 'relaxing,' 'diggin it.'
    *   Waitress was 'very nice and helpful,' and 'fabulous,' providing excellent customer service (cucumber water).
    *   One specific dish, the 'lemongrass chicken,' was 'amazing!! so good.'

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   DJ music was 'a little odd for my taste.'
    *   Menu structure: 'everything... served as appetizers... which kinda sucks..'
    *   Pricing: 'at least 6-12 bucks' each, recommending 2-3 per person, making it 'kinda pricey.'
    *   Gyoza: 'alright.. a little too minty for my taste.'
    *   Hot stone cooking: 'alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me...' (dislikes undercooked meat).
    *   Beef wrapped in grape leaves: 'sadly disappointed... so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY...' (Major complaint about lack of disclosure and spiciness being too extreme, also mentions 'health hazard?!').
    *   Overall summary states 'the food... eh...' and 'the menu is crap...'
    *   Reinforces pricing: 'kinda on the pricey side...'

4. **Intensity of Language Used:**
    *   **Positive:** 'amazing!!', 'fabulous', 'so good', 'relaxing', 'diggin it'.
    *   **Negative:** 'kinda sucks', 'kinda pricey', 'a little odd', 'sadly disappointed', 'fiery hot', 'almost had tears in my eyes', 'SPICY' (capitalized), 'gasping for water', 'health hazard?!', 'the food... eh...', 'the menu is crap...'. The phrase 'the menu is crap' and the 'health hazard' comment are particularly strong and indicate deep dissatisfaction.

5. **Determination of Recommendation:** The reviewer states, 'i think i would go back again... But I don't think I would opt to...' followed by 'maybe a different location would be better?'. This is a very weak, almost non-existent recommendation. They wouldn't actively choose to return, indicating that the negatives outweigh the positives despite the great atmosphere and service.

6. **Star Rating Assignment:** While the atmosphere and service received glowing praise (easily 4-5 stars for those categories), the core elements of the dining experience—the food itself, the menu structure, pricing, and critically, the lack of disclosure for spicy items—were significant drawbacks. The 'menu is crap' and 'health hazard' comments are severe. Multiple dishes were disappointing or just 'alright,' and the reviewer would not 'opt' to return. The combination of excellent service/atmosphere with significantly flawed food/menu/value/safety aspects, resulting in a non-recommendation, points to a rating that is below average but not outright terrible. A 2-star rating reflects significant dissatisfaction and a refusal to return voluntarily, while acknowledging the few strong positive points.","```json

    *   Pleasant surprises in the natural foods section, including new bulk dispensers.
    *   Checkout is always quick, described as much faster than competitors.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**

"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...",3,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment**: The sentiment is mixed but leans positive due to strong praise for the core dining experience, tempered by a significant negative point regarding pricing.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects**: The reviewer explicitly states ""Excellent food"" and ""top-notch service,"" indicating a highly satisfying experience in these crucial areas.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints**: The primary complaint is that the restaurant is ""exorbitantly priced."" This is reinforced by the warning, ""Not for budget minded diners.""
4. **Intensity of Language Used**: The language is very strong on both sides: ""Excellent"" and ""top-notch"" are highly positive superlatives. ""Exorbitantly priced"" is also a very strong negative descriptor for cost, implying it's beyond reasonable. The warning is direct and clear.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place**: The reviewer would likely recommend this place, but with a strong caveat regarding the price. The phrase ""Not for budget minded diners"" implies that for those *not* on a budget, it would be a highly recommended experience due to the food and service.
6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars**: A 4-star rating is predicted. The stellar quality of the food and service (which are typically the most heavily weighted factors for a restaurant review) pushes the rating significantly above average. However, the ""exorbitantly priced"" nature is a major detractor, preventing a perfect 5-star score. A 3-star rating would imply an 'average' or 'okay' experience, which contradicts the 'excellent' and 'top-notch' descriptions. The overall experience, while costly, was clearly very good.","```json

The phrase \""Not for budget minded diners\"" implies that for those *not* on a budget, it would be a highly recommended experience due to the food and service.\n6. **Assign a rating from 1-5 stars**: A 4-star rating is predicted. The stellar quality of the food and service (which are typically the most heavily weighted factors for a restaurant review) pushes the rating significantly above average. However, the \""exorbitantly priced\"" nature is a major detractor, preventing a perfect 5-star score. A 3-star rating would imply an 'average' or 'okay' experience, which contradicts the 'excellent' and 'top-notch' descriptions. The overall experience, while costly, was clearly very good.""

"You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. 

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!

I look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.",3,2,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is predominantly negative, bordering on disappointed. While there's strong praise for the salad, it's overshadowed by numerous criticisms regarding the new location's ambiance, cleanliness, and the quality of another food item (the Cuban sandwich).

2.  **Specific positive aspects:**
    *   Enjoys the vibe of the *original* Market Bistro (implying the brand has potential).
    *   The salad-making process was enjoyable for the reviewer ('control freak in me of course got off on the salad making').
    *   The salad itself was highly praised: 'probably the best salad Ive made to date,' 'patent your creations,' 'just so complete and delicious!'
    *   The reviewer states, 'I look forward to coming again,' but this is immediately qualified by a desire for significant improvements.

3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   The new location feels like a 'fuzzy copy,' 'not as sharp,' and 'isn't quite as pulled together' compared to the original.
    *   Lack of a lounging area.
    *   'Weird particle board chic tables' (criticism of decor).
    *   'Every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace' (major cleanliness issue).
    *   'Grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill' (major hygiene/cleanliness issue).
    *   'No forks?' (operational/service oversight).
    *   Cuban sandwich: 'okay' at best, but criticized for 'thick and chewy' ciabatta rolls causing toppings to 'fire out the back.'
    *   Cuban sandwich also had an 'Asian spice, like cardemom??' which was unexpected and disliked.
    *   The Mr (reviewer's companion) 'didn't like it at all' (referring to the Cuban sandwich).
    *   The Mr was 'confused as to why I went on and on' until tasting the good salad, implying his initial experience (likely including the sandwich) was negative.

4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite intense for the negative points: 'fuzzy around the edges,' 'weird particle board chic tables,' 'every table was dirty,' 'grease dripping,' 'No forks?'. The phrase 'I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB' acknowledges the heavy criticism. The praise for the salad is also very strong ('best salad Ive made to date,' 'patent your creations!'), creating a stark contrast.

5.  **Reviewer's recommendation:** The reviewer does *not* offer a clear recommendation. The statement 'I look forward to coming again' is immediately followed by a strong caveat: 'I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.' This indicates that the current state is unsatisfactory and a return visit is conditional on significant improvements. They would likely only recommend the salad, and only if other fundamental issues were resolved.

6.  **Assigned rating (1-5 stars):** A 2-star rating is appropriate. While the salad is clearly a standout positive, the sheer volume and severity of the negative points, especially regarding cleanliness (dirty tables, dripping grease) and fundamental operational issues (no forks, poorly executed sandwich, disappointing ambiance), bring the overall experience down significantly. A 3-star rating would imply an average experience, but the issues here are too critical to be considered average. The strong positives for the salad prevent it from being a 1-star (terrible, no redeeming qualities) experience, but the new location has serious problems that need addressing.","```json

"They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.

Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.

Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.

My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.

The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.",3,3,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is mixed. There are clear positives and negatives regarding the food, and a somewhat humorous/observational closing remark about the owner.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   High-definition pictures of menu items on walls (liked by the reviewer).
    *   Chicken and tofu in the Pad Thai were cooked perfectly.
    *   Spring rolls were great.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Noodles in the Pad Thai were a bit chewy.
    *   Spring rolls were served whole, not in halves as pictured (minor discrepancy).
    *   Suggests skipping the beef balls in the Thai noodle bowl.
    *   Thai noodle bowl is very bland if ordered with no spice.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:**
    *   Positives use strong words like 'perfectly' and 'great.'
    *   Negatives are moderate: 'a bit chewy,' 'Id suggest skipping,' 'very bland.' The spring roll discrepancy is minor.
    *   The final paragraph about the owner is observational and a bit sarcastic/humorous, but not intensely critical of the dining experience itself.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer offers qualified advice ('skip on the beef balls,' 'bland if you order with no spice') rather than an outright condemnation or ringing endorsement. There are strong positives, but also specific negative warnings that affect the experience of certain dishes. This suggests a neutral or very qualified recommendation, leaning towards 'you might find some good things, but be aware of the pitfalls.'

"Average airport. 

I wish gate Marques listed which zone was boarding. There were three airplanes loading at the same time and it was near impossible to tell which gate was loading which zone. We just waited a few minutes and rolled the dice that our zone was loading.",3,2,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The review starts with 'Average airport,' which is neutral, but the subsequent text details a significant and frustrating problem, quickly shifting the overall sentiment to negative.
2.  **Specific Positive Aspects:** There are no positive aspects mentioned. 'Average airport' sets a baseline that the specific experience described fails to meet.
3.  **Specific Negative Aspects/Complaints:** The primary complaint is the lack of clear boarding zone information at the gate, especially when multiple airplanes were loading simultaneously. The reviewer found it 'near impossible' to discern which zone was boarding and felt forced to 'roll the dice' to board.
4.  **Intensity of Language:** The phrase 'near impossible to tell' conveys strong frustration and a significant operational failure. 'Rolled the dice' indicates a lack of control, confusion, and inconvenience. While not overtly angry, the language highlights a deeply unsatisfactory experience regarding a core airport function.
5.  **Would Recommend?:** The reviewer would likely not recommend this airport (or specifically this gate's operation) to others, or at least would issue a strong warning about the boarding process. The issues described detract significantly from the airport experience.
6.  **Star Rating:** While it begins with 'Average,' the entire remainder of the review describes a critical failure in a fundamental airport process. No positive aspects are mentioned to balance this. The problem caused significant confusion and inconvenience ('near impossible,' 'rolled the dice'). This isn't a minor flaw. It's a major operational issue that would severely impact a traveler's experience. It's not a 1-star complete disaster (e.g., missed flight, extreme rudeness, health hazard), but it's well below average and clearly a poor experience. Therefore, 2 stars is the most appropriate rating.","```json

Seems to be family owned and does have a good atmosphere. But at these prices, I wonder how long it will be around. There were lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning, which has to be the bread and butter of a place like this.",3,2,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is predominantly negative. While starting with a positive note about the food, the review quickly shifts to significant complaints about pricing, value, menu limitations, and even questions the business's long-term viability.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   'Good food'
    *   'Seems to be family owned' (often a positive connotation)
    *   'does have a good atmosphere'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   'very expensive for a simple breakfast joint' (main complaint)
    *   '$8-10 for most breakfast items' (specific example of high cost)
    *   'menu has very few healthy options' (problem for wife, indicating a wider customer issue)
    *   Suggests adding an 'egg white omelet' (highlighting a perceived lack)
    *   'at these prices, I wonder how long it will be around' (strong criticism of business model viability)
    *   'lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning' (negative observation, reinforces concern about viability and value for money).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is quite intense for the negatives. Phrases like 'very expensive,' 'simple breakfast joint' (implying disproportionate cost), 'very few healthy options,' and especially 'I wonder how long it will be around' and 'lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning' convey strong dissatisfaction and concern for the business's future, going beyond a mere preference.
5. **Would Reviewer Recommend:** The reviewer would likely NOT recommend this place. Despite the 'good food,' the overwhelming concerns about price, value, lack of options, and the critical observation of empty tables on a key day suggest the overall experience was poor and not worth the cost.
6. **Assigned Rating:** A 2-star rating is appropriate. The 'good food' prevents a 1-star, but the extensive and strongly worded complaints about high prices, poor value, menu deficiencies, and the questioning of the business's survival (reinforced by the observation of empty tables on a busy day) pull the rating well below average.

Words like 'Unfortunately,' 'just ok,' 'not $140.00 great,' 'only took 1 bite,' 'very disappointing,' and 'hasn't happened' (referring to being wowed) clearly indicate a poor experience during their recent visits.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** There are no specific positive aspects mentioned about the current experience. The phrase 'It would be good, if it was cheaper' is a conditional statement indicating that at its current price point, it is *not* good.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Food quality was 'just ok' on the last two visits.
    *   The food was 'definitely not $140.00 great,' highlighting a severe lack of value for money.
    *   A cupcake served with a combo was so bad the reviewer 'only took 1 bite.'
    *   Missing a favorite item ('chocolate explosion') from the menu, suggesting a decline or disappointment.
    *   The overall experience was 'very disappointing.'
    *   The restaurant failed to 'wow' the reviewer, which was an expectation for the high price point ($140.00).
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is strong and explicit in its negativity: 'Unfortunately,' 'definitely not $140.00 great,' 'only took 1 bite' (implying extreme distaste), and 'very disappointing.' The repeated emphasis on the high price ($140.00) and the failure to meet expectations ('you really want to be wowed... and that hasn't happened') further amplifies the negative intensity.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer would clearly *not* recommend this place at its current price point or quality. Their statement 'It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed... and that hasn't happened' serves as a direct warning against visiting under current conditions.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the consistent and strong negative feedback, the severe disappointment regarding value for money, the explicit failure of a specific dish (cupcake), and the overall 'very disappointing' sentiment, a 1-star rating is appropriate. The review indicates a terrible experience for the price, effectively warning others away.","```json

Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. That's what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.,3,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment that high expectations were not met, primarily due to poor service, despite a good dessert.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only specific positive is that ""The dessert was very good however!"".
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaint is that ""Our bartender was not friendly at all."" The reviewer also notes that their ""very high expectations"" were not met, implying an overall disappointing experience.
4. **Intensity of language used:** ""Not friendly at all"" is a strong negative descriptor for the bartender's service. ""Very good"" is a strong positive for the dessert. The concluding sentence, ""Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night,"" indicates disappointment but also a degree of understanding and a willingness to give the establishment another chance, which slightly softens the overall negativity.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Based on this particular experience, the reviewer would likely not recommend the place due to the unfriendly service. However, the closing remark suggests they are open to returning themselves, indicating it's not a complete write-off, but certainly not a positive recommendation based on this visit.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The strong negative point about the bartender's unfriendliness is a significant detractor. While the dessert was very good, it doesn't completely offset the core service failure and the overall feeling of unmet expectations. The willingness to give them another chance (the ""off night"" comment) prevents it from being a 1-star review (which would imply a total disaster with no redeeming qualities).

  ""explanation"": ""1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment that high expectations were not met, primarily due to poor service, despite a good dessert.\n2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The only specific positive is that \""The dessert was very good however!\"".\n3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaint is that \""Our bartender was not friendly at all.\"" The reviewer also notes that their \""very high expectations\"" were not met, implying an overall disappointing experience.\n4. **Intensity of language used:** \""Not friendly at all\"" is a strong negative descriptor for the bartender's service. \""Very good\"" is a strong positive for the dessert. The concluding sentence, \""Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night,\"" indicates disappointment but also a degree of understanding and a willingness to give the establishment another chance, which slightly softens the overall negativity.\n5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Based on this particular experience, the reviewer would likely not recommend the place due to the unfriendly service. However, the closing remark suggests they are open to returning themselves, indicating it's not a complete write-off, but certainly not a positive recommendation based on this visit.\n6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The strong negative point about the bartender's unfriendliness is a significant detractor. While the dessert was very good, it doesn't completely offset the core service failure and the overall feeling of unmet expectations. The willingness to give them another chance (the \""off night\"" comment) prevents it from being a 1-star review (which would imply a total disaster with no redeeming qualities). However, the major service issue makes it worse than an average (3-star) experience. Therefore, 2 stars (Poor) is the most fitting rating.""

"I'm always on the lookout for a morning coffee place  and decided to stop at the Coffee Bean. Since I am always interested in trying new places, it looked inviting and clean, and was close to where I was going.They had the usual items you find in a coffee shop, and there was ample seating, with outside tables. That said, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. However, if I am in the area, and need coffee to drink while reading my newspaper, this is a good option.",3,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is generally positive, with a notable qualification. The reviewer highlights several positive attributes and concludes with a conditional recommendation, despite noting a lack of uniqueness.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer found the place 'inviting and clean', 'close to where I was going' (convenience), and noted 'ample seating, with outside tables'. Crucially, the review ends by stating it 'is a good option' under specific circumstances.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary 'negative' is 'it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.' This isn't a complaint about poor quality, service, or cleanliness, but rather a lack of unique features or exceptionality. There are no complaints about the coffee or items themselves.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is moderate. Words like 'inviting,' 'clean,' 'ample,' and 'good option' are positive but not overly enthusiastic. The phrase 'not anything out of the ordinary' is neutral-to-mildly critical but lacks strong negative emotion.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, conditionally. The reviewer states, 'if I am in the area, and need coffee... this is a good option.' This implies a recommendation for its practical use and convenience, rather than a destination spot.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The positive aspects (cleanliness, inviting atmosphere, ample seating, convenience) combined with the concluding statement 'this is a good option' outweigh the single observation that it's 'not anything out of the ordinary.' While not a rave review, it clearly expresses satisfaction with its basic function and overall pleasantness. A 3-star rating often implies 'average' or 'okay,' but the reviewer's specific positives push it beyond just 'okay.' A 4-star rating ('good' or 'I like it') aligns better with a clean, inviting place that offers ample seating, good basic items, and is considered a 'good option' despite not being unique. It's a strong functional recommendation.","```json

"After reading Lindsey's review, I had to think twice about my original review of this place. Yes, I had been back and gave it another shot.

Yes, perhaps, I was a bit douchy in my prior review. 

This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).

They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.

The spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Don't listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work.",3,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** Very positive. The reviewer explicitly retracts a previous negative review, admitting they were 'douchy' and 'having a bad day.' The current review is a strong endorsement.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The reviewer calls it 'definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch,' describes it as 'fairly comfortable,' and notes it's 'better for you.' They highly recommend a specific item: 'The spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it.' They also explicitly state 'Don't listen to my old review.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The only negative comment is 'They tend to water down their Sriracha.' However, this is immediately rationalized as 'it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some,' which significantly mitigates the negativity.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is quite strong in its positivity ('definitely a great spot,' 'the way to go,' 'Try it'). The self-deprecating language about their previous review ('douchy,' 'bad day at work') further intensifies the current positive message by contrasting it with their prior unfairness.
5. **Recommendation:** Yes, the reviewer strongly recommends the place, especially the spicy chicken bowl, and urges readers to disregard their past negative opinion.
6. **Based on all factors:** The overwhelming positive re-evaluation, strong recommendations, and the rationalization of the only minor complaint point towards a top rating. The reviewer is actively trying to correct a past wrong and is enthusiastic about the place, particularly a specific dish. This indicates a 'Loved it' experience, rather than just 'Liked it.'","```json

"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.

I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.

Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.",3,3,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment**: The initial sentiment is strongly negative, with the reviewer expressing a dislike for both Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and Southwest Airlines (multiple 'Boo!'s, 'not a huge fan', 'least favorite carriers'). However, this strong initial negativity is consistently tempered by mitigating phrases throughout the review, such as 'you can do worse than Southwest', 'somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit', and 'every once in a while it's a painless operation'. The sentiment evolves from very negative expectations to a grudging acceptance that it's tolerable, or even a better option than alternatives given the circumstances. It's a sentiment of 'it's not great, but it's not as bad as it could be, and sometimes it's surprisingly okay'. This leads to a neutral-to-slightly-positive overall sentiment when considering the actual experience versus the stated dislike.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned**: 'you can do worse than Southwest', 'bags fly free thing is genius' (very strong positive), 'somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit' (implies a better outcome than expected), 'not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim' (good airport positioning/convenience), 'decent presence here', 'may actually find a human who can help', 'every once in a while it's a painless operation' (occasional positive experience).
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints**: Reviewer is 'not a huge fan' and considers Southwest 'one of my least favorite carriers' and Sky Harbor their 'least favorite airport'. Refers to the combination as a 'recipe for disaster'. Specific incidents: 'leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather', 'force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights'. Implies that painless operations are not the norm ('every once in a while').
4.  **Intensity of language used**: High intensity on both sides. Strong negative words: 'Boo!', 'least favorite', 'recipe for disaster', 'stranded', 'dash across the airport'. Strong positive word: 'genius' (for bags fly free). This emotional language suggests a reviewer with strong opinions, making the positive mitigations even more significant.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place**: The reviewer would likely offer a qualified recommendation. They wouldn't enthusiastically recommend it as a top choice, but given the constraints (traveling through Sky Harbor, which they dislike), they imply that Southwest is a *sensible* or *better-than-average* choice among airlines operating there. The phrases 'you can do worse' and 'somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit' suggest a preference for Southwest over other unknown or worse alternatives in this specific context, despite their personal dislike. It's a pragmatic recommendation, not an emotional one.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars**: Despite the reviewer's strong personal dislike and specific negative experiences, the consistent tempering of the criticism and the acknowledgment of significant benefits ('bags fly free is genius', good airport positioning, better-than-expected outcomes) pull the rating up from a 1 or 2. While not a glowing endorsement, it's presented as a tolerable and sometimes even advantageous option when faced with a generally disliked airport. The balance between specific pain points and significant practical advantages (especially the 'genius' free bags and the 'you can do worse' sentiment) lands it squarely in the average territory, indicating it's 'okay' and often functional. A 3-star rating ('It was okay') best reflects this complex, mixed sentiment where expectations are low but the actual experience often exceeds them sufficiently to be considered acceptable.","```json

The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location.' They laud the 'perfect jalapeno cheese burger' and say 'The fries are really good too.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The reviewer complains that 'The location kind of sucks.' They elaborate by mentioning it's 'surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall,' concluding with the rhetorical 'Need I say more?' to emphasize its undesirability.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language is very strong ('favorite,' 'perfect,' 'really good'). The negative language is also quite intense ('sucks,' 'Need I say more?'), painting a vivid picture of an undesirable area.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Despite the significant negative points about the location, the reviewer's declaration that it's their 'favorite Lenny's location' due to the food strongly implies a recommendation for anyone prioritizing food quality. The food is so good it seems to outweigh the location for *them*.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The review presents a clear dichotomy: outstanding food (5-star quality) and a very poor location (1-2 star quality). Since the primary purpose of a restaurant is its food, and the food is described as 'perfect' and makes it their 'favorite' location, the stellar food quality elevates the overall rating.

"I created a monster when I brought my family to Chipotle for the first time many years ago. I am constantly taking one for ""the team"" when I am dragged here by my wife and one of my sons.

I just wish there was the option of adding tomatoes to your taco without the onions and cilantro. How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?",3,2,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is negative from the reviewer's personal perspective. Phrases like ""I created a monster,"" ""constantly taking one for 'the team',"" and ""dragged here by my wife and one of my sons"" clearly indicate a strong reluctance and lack of personal enjoyment in visiting Chipotle. He views the visits as a personal sacrifice.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer does mention specific items he orders: ""carnitas tacos with the salsa that has the little tomatoes, onions and cilantro."" He also ""ponies up an extra $1.80 for the guacamole,"" implying he values the guacamole enough to pay extra for it. These indicate that he finds *something* acceptable or even desirable on the menu, though it doesn't outweigh his general reluctance.
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary negative aspects are his compulsory visits (""dragged here,"" ""taking one for the team"") and a specific menu customization complaint: ""I just wish there was the option of adding tomatoes to your taco without the onions and cilantro."" He emphasizes this with the rhetorical question, ""How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?""
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language conveys moderate intensity of frustration and resignation. ""Created a monster"" is a strong opening, framing his family's love for Chipotle as a personal burden. ""Constantly taking one for 'the team'"" and ""dragged here"" vividly illustrate his unwillingness. ""Pony up an extra $1.80"" suggests a begrudging payment. The rhetorical question about tacos without tomatoes/guacamole highlights a strong personal preference that isn't being met.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer would highly unlikely recommend this place based on his personal experience. His visits are not by choice, and he clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the experience and specific menu limitations. While his family enjoys it, his review focuses on his own negative interactions.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating:** Despite finding specific items he can eat (carnitas, guacamole), the overwhelming tone of personal reluctance, sacrifice, and being forced to visit (""dragged here,"" ""taking one for the team"") pulls the rating significantly down. His specific complaint about menu customization further contributes to his dissatisfaction. While he doesn't call the food terrible, his personal experience is clearly negative.

"Loved the location at atmosphere of this place!  Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and I'd recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!  

We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone!

The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.

We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before we've finished dessert.  Both of these happened here.",4,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses strong positive language for most aspects of their experience, despite mentioning minor service issues at the end.

3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only complaints relate to service timing: it was 'not well-timed,' plates were cleared individually while others were still eating, and the bill was brought before dessert was finished.

"I'm not sure how I've missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I can't believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit!

It was packed on the New Year's Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. I'm knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses regret for not trying the place sooner, praises most of the food and service, and only deducts a star for one specific, isolated issue.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The only explicit complaint leading to a deduction is that 'the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste.' The service was 'a bit slow' but immediately excused given the busy holiday.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is quite expressive ('Dammit!'). The phrase 'knocking off a star' is a direct and measured statement of deduction, indicating a logical rather than emotional response to the negative point. 'Very good,' 'friendly,' and 'professional' are strong positive descriptors.

"Not much to write here. I always park on the Sears (upper level) side when I visit Chandler mall. My last visit to the mall, I ended up buying a luggage set on sale at Sears. The cashier was helpful and even checked to see if all four pieces were present (I didn't even think to, LOL). Four stars. No negative feedback to report.",4,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is strongly positive. The reviewer highlights helpful staff and a successful shopping trip, explicitly stating 'No negative feedback to report.'

"There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR. 

Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. 

Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. 

If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.

It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.

WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:
Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!

Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer does list some areas for improvement, the language used for positive aspects is far more intense and frequent, culminating in a direct endorsement.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Happy Hour (1/2 off appetizers, discounts on pints) - described with ""glorious words"" and ""matters so much to me.""
    *   Food: Brie with ""unbelievable apple chutney,"" Lamb stew (hearty, huge serving), Shepherd's pie (pretty tasty), Veggie burger (""Yum""), 'Tator wedges (fresh, crispy, ""DIVINE,"" still has cravings).
    *   Casual atmosphere.
    *   Live music is offered (though wishes for more).
    *   Outside patio is great.
    *   Concluding statement: ""Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!""
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Cannot sample liquors (though reviewer says ""Fair enough"").
    *   Wants a larger beer selection (including bottles).
    *   Too noisy and crowded at night.
    *   Likely standing if not early enough (uncomfortable).
    *   Wishes for more live music.
    *   Wishes they had darts (implies having to go elsewhere for specific amenities/beer).
4. **Intensity of language used:** The positive language is highly enthusiastic: ""glorious words,"" ""matters so much to me,"" ""unbelievable,"" ""hearty,"" ""huge,"" ""pretty tasty,"" ""Yum,"" ""DIVINE,"" ""I STILL have cravings for them!"", and most notably, ""Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!"". The negative language is softer, framed as suggestions (""If I could change one thing...""), wishes (""I wish they offered more""), or statements of inconvenience (""doesn't make for a very comfortable experience""), rather than strong condemnation.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer strongly recommends the place, especially for its food and happy hour. The specific recommendations for what to try (brie, lamb stew, veggie burger, tator wedges) and advice (""Word to wise,"" ""Word to NON-MEAT EATERS"") are clear indicators of a positive recommendation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The explicit statement ""Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!"" combined with the consistent, enthusiastic praise for the food, the happy hour, and the overall positive tone, outweighs the relatively minor and mildly phrased complaints about atmosphere or selection.

"Want a unique date night?  Craving for something to do on your own?  Want to have an avenue to express your inner artistic abilities?  OK, here you go!

A great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.  

Good for a keepsake, special gift, 1-of-a-kind conversation piece, or create a memory.

1 star lost for the very annoying and extremely intrusive studio ""helper"" which I will leave un-named.  Kinda ruined alot of the experience.  I should say that if you need assistance, you can have it, but when you do NOT need it, well, please leave us alone - ie: i f you are in Barnes & Noble, you don't need a clerk to repeatedly come up to you every 10 mins to ask if you are going to buy that book or they read it, or do you want a better suggestion..... ect.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is largely positive regarding the concept, the activity, and the benefits of the place ('zen out,' 'create a memory'). However, there is a very strong and explicit negative sentiment concerning a 'studio helper' that significantly impacted the experience.
2. **Positive Aspects:** The reviewer praises the 'unique date night' and 'avenue to express artistic abilities' concept. They describe it as a 'very interesting concept,' a 'great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.' They also list positive outcomes like 'keepsake, special gift, 1-of-a-kind conversation piece, or create a memory.' The process itself is described positively, leading to a 'masterpiece.'
3. **Negative Aspects/Complaints:** The sole, but very significant, complaint is directed at a 'very annoying and extremely intrusive studio ""helper""' who 'Kinda ruined alot of the experience.' The reviewer likens the intrusiveness to a clerk repeatedly bothering a customer in a bookstore, emphasizing that help was not needed or wanted.
4. **Intensity of Language:** The positive language is quite strong ('unique,' 'craving,' 'masterpiece,' 'great place to zen out'). The negative language is equally strong, using phrases like 'very annoying,' 'extremely intrusive,' and 'Kinda ruined alot of the experience.' Crucially, the reviewer explicitly states '1 star lost' for this issue.
5. **Recommendation:** The reviewer would likely recommend the place, but with a significant caveat or warning about potential staff intrusiveness. The core offering and its benefits are described in highly appealing terms, suggesting value despite the one negative experience.
6. **Star Rating:** The review starts with glowing praise, indicating a high baseline (likely 5 stars) for the concept and experience itself. The reviewer then explicitly states '1 star lost' due to the intrusive helper. Deducting one star from an implied 5-star potential leads to a 4-star rating. While the phrase 'Kinda ruined alot of the experience' is strong, the specific numerical deduction and the extensive positive description of the place's core value suggest that the overall experience was still good, but significantly marred by this one interaction.","```json

3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only complaint is that 'they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore.'

"Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!

Place - Small.
Food - Fantastic.
Wait - Usually.
Bathroom - An adventure.

We didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.

The bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!",4,5,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses surprise at not having reviewed it sooner, implying a long-standing positive impression. Key positives like 'Fantastic' food and 'spot on' service dominate, with any potential negatives reframed as quirks or acceptable trade-offs for quality.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Food: ""Fantastic,"" ""very, very good,"" ""local.""
    *   Service: ""fast, and spot on.""
    *   Wait: While usually long, the reviewer states it's ""par for the course when the food is good,"" implying it's worth it.
    *   Bathroom: Described as ""an adventure"" but ultimately framed as ""one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!"" (a positive spin on uniqueness).
    *   Overall place: ""stand-out sort of place.""
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Place: ""Small."" (A minor observation, not a complaint).
    *   Wait: ""Usually"" long waits, ""crazy waits."" (Acknowledged, but immediately mitigated by the high quality of food).
    *   Bathroom: ""An adventure,"" ""next door in an old motel."" (Initially quirky, but then praised as a unique feature).
    There are no strong, unmitigated complaints.
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly positive and enthusiastic. Words like ""Fantastic,"" ""very, very good,"" ""spot on,"" and ""stand-out sort of place"" indicate strong approval. Even the descriptions of wait times (""crazy waits"") are used to emphasize the food's desirability.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely. The entire review is a glowing endorsement, highlighting the excellent food and service, and even finding charm in its unique characteristics. The opening line implies a strong recommendation.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelmingly positive sentiment, the strong praise for food and service, the acceptance and even appreciation of minor inconveniences as unique features, and the highly positive language, this review unequivocally warrants a 5-star rating.","```json

The phrase 'even more' also intensifies the positive impact of the pizza on their desire to move.\n5. **Would Recommend:** Given the extremely positive language, the complete absence of negatives, and the strong praise for the food, the reviewer would undoubtedly recommend this place. The comment about wanting to move to the area more because of the pizza is a very strong endorsement.\n6. **Assigned Rating:** Based on all factors, particularly the complete lack of negatives, the highly enthusiastic language, and the direct praise, a 5-star rating is appropriate.""

The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didn't annoy me. I'd go back,4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is positive. The reviewer raves about the food, dismisses the service issues as non-annoying, and explicitly states an intent to return.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The reviewer stated, 'The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good.' This is a strong positive for the core product. The phrase 'I'd go back' is a definitive positive indicator of satisfaction and future intent.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects:** The only negative mentioned is, 'The service was marginal at best.'
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language ('really good', 'very good') is strong and enthusiastic. The negative language ('marginal at best') is moderate, but its impact is significantly softened by 'but it didn't annoy me.' The phrase 'I'd go back' is a strong, definitive positive.
5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly states 'I'd go back,' which is a strong recommendation or at least an indication of sufficient satisfaction to revisit.
6. **Star Rating Assignment:** The excellent food (a primary driver for restaurants), combined with the reviewer's explicit intent to return, overrides the 'marginal' service, especially since the service didn't annoy them. A perfect 5-star rating might be held back by the service issue, but the overall experience is clearly above average and warrants a strong positive rating. A 4-star rating reflects a very good experience with a minor, tolerable flaw.","```json

"Cevapi and Burek oh my!! Plus I got to hang with my fabulous friend Amra! Score! We wanted something extra good to eat after finishing our Mud Factor race on Saturday and lord knows I have been craving some Cevapi so off we went to Euro Bakery. It was already bookmarked as a place I wanted to try so this was a win, win in my book. 

Everything is made fresh to order and once you walk in, you can smell the fresh baked bread that they have made throughout the day. There is also a mini grocery store for you to buy items as well.  My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.

Will I come back? Hmm heck yes, but alas this treat can only be saved for when I burn off and absurd amount of calories so that I can indulge and not feel guilty at all.  Hmm Cevapi and Burek = one VERY happy woman!",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Phrases like 'oh my!!', 'Score!', 'extra good', 'win, win in my book', 'piping hot and piled high', 'dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have', 'heck yes', and 'one VERY happy woman!' all indicate extreme satisfaction.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer explicitly praises the Cevapi and Burek, describing them as 'extra good'. They highlight that everything is 'made fresh to order', the 'fresh baked bread' smell, the Cevapi being 'piping hot and piled high', and the Burek being 'huge'. The mini grocery store is also mentioned as a positive feature. The reviewer also notes that the place was already bookmarked, indicating prior interest and positive expectation that was met or exceeded.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There are absolutely no negative aspects or complaints mentioned about the restaurant, its food, service, or atmosphere. The only slight caveat is the reviewer's personal decision to save the treat for when they've burned calories, which actually emphasizes how delicious and indulgent the food is, rather than being a criticism of the establishment.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language used is very enthusiastic and intense, with multiple exclamation points, strong adjectives ('fabulous', 'extra good', 'absurd amount', 'VERY happy'), and hyperbole ('dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have'). The statement 'Will I come back? Hmm heck yes' is particularly strong.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Will I come back? Hmm heck yes,' which is a strong affirmation of recommendation and intent to return.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the consistently strong positive language, the absence of any complaints, the explicit praise for the food quality and freshness, and the clear intention to return, a 5-star rating is the only logical conclusion.","```json

"I love this outdoor mall.  It's clean, it's open and has a wonderful restaurant selection.  It doesn't have a huge amount of stores but the stores it does have fits the bill. Now that it has J Crew life got a little sweeter.  I really miss the Border book store, however. 

Some cool Biltmore activities are yoga in the park and movies in the park.  The movies are usually classics and happen during the fall.  Another bonus, is it's super dog friendly.

"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho.",4,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is positive. While the main dish (pho) received a lukewarm assessment, several other items and the overall experience were highly praised, culminating in a clear statement of intent to return.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Pho was 'good' (though not 'great').
    *   Spring roll was 'amazing'.
    *   Crab (from appetizer plate) was 'great'.
    *   Egg roll was 'definitely fresh' (even if taste wasn't preferred).
    *   Fresh coconut juice was 'delightful'.
    *   The reviewer explicitly states, 'I would go back again for sure'.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   The pho was described as 'much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles' and 'not great, just good'. This is contextualized by it being the reviewer's first time having pho.
    *   Didn't like the 'egg roll' as much as expected.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The positive language is strong: 'amazing', 'great', 'delightful', 'for sure'. The negative language is milder: 'not great, just good', 'didn't like as much'. The comparison to Ramen Noodles is slightly dismissive but is tempered by the 'good' rating for the pho.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly states, 'I would go back again for sure,' which is a strong recommendation for the restaurant, albeit with a note to try something other than the pho.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The numerous strong positive descriptors ('amazing', 'great', 'delightful') for multiple items, coupled with the explicit intent to return 'for sure', indicate a very positive experience. The criticisms are specific, relatively mild (especially considering the reviewer's first-time experience with pho), and do not deter them from wanting to revisit the establishment. This aligns well with a 4-star rating: a very good experience with minor, specific drawbacks, but strong enough to warrant a return visit and recommendation.","```json

"The Paseo Trail travels through Chandler along the Consolidated Canal.  It runs mostly N-S, connecting to other trails along the canal in Mesa and Gilbert, totaling around 18 miles.

The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians.

There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll.

One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.  Most are not marked for motorists as trail crossings and there is no crosswalk so you may be faced with a relatively long wait to get a break in traffic or forcing the issue and forging ahead with care.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is primarily descriptive and informative, with a positive lean. The reviewer provides a lot of practical details about the trail's features, accessibility, and usage.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The review highlights numerous positives:
    *   Long trail (18 miles) connecting to other areas.
    *   Varied surfaces (paved and pea gravel hard pack).
    *   Runs along diverse scenery (subdivisions, golf courses, farms).
    *   Very gentle grade, making it accessible.
    *   Suitable for joggers, bicyclists, and equestrians.
    *   Ample and easy-to-find parking options are clearly detailed, including specific starting points.
    *   Describes a pleasant ride dynamic (slight uphill north, relaxing roll back).
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The review mentions only one explicit ""issue"":
    *   Crossings with major streets are not marked for motorists as trail crossings.
    *   Lack of crosswalks.
    *   Leads to potentially long waits for a break in traffic or requiring users to ""force the issue and forging ahead with care"" (implying inconvenience and a potential safety concern).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is mostly factual and observational. Positive terms like ""very gentle,"" ""easy to find,"" ""plenty,"" and ""nice relaxing roll"" are moderately positive but not overly effusive. The negative language, while highlighting a significant flaw (""One issue,"" ""not marked,"" ""no crosswalk""), is presented without strong emotional intensity or harsh criticism. It's a statement of fact about a problem rather than an angry complaint.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer would likely recommend this place, but with a clear caveat about the street crossings. The overwhelming amount of detailed positive information and helpful tips (like parking locations and ride dynamics) indicates a desire to share a generally good experience, despite the one notable flaw. The tone is more guiding and informative than dissuading.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The extensive list of positive features and helpful information, combined with a factual tone, suggests a generally positive experience. The single negative point regarding street crossings is significant for safety and convenience, preventing a 5-star rating. However, it doesn't overshadow the numerous positives enough to drop it to 3 stars or lower, which would imply an average or below-average experience. Therefore, 4 stars is appropriate, signifying a very good experience with a specific, notable flaw.","```json

The negative language, while highlighting a significant flaw (\""One issue,\"" \""not marked,\"" \""no crosswalk\""), is presented without strong emotional intensity or harsh criticism. It's a statement of fact about a problem rather than an angry complaint.\n5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer would likely recommend this place, but with a clear caveat about the street crossings. The overwhelming amount of detailed positive information and helpful tips (like parking locations and ride dynamics) indicates a desire to share a generally good experience, despite the one notable flaw. The tone is more guiding and informative than dissuading.\n6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The extensive list of positive features and helpful information, combined with a factual tone, suggests a generally positive experience. The single negative point regarding street crossings is significant for safety and convenience, preventing a 5-star rating. However, it doesn't overshadow the numerous positives enough to drop it to 3 stars or lower, which would imply an average or below-average experience. Therefore, 4 stars is appropriate, signifying a very good experience with a specific, notable flaw.""

"I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one! A semblance of a normal crowd. We ended up talking with some weirdo local chick, thought they were trying to do some kind of bizarre swinger plot, and they kicked rocks. Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing. Maybe it was because I was inebriated, but the Karaoke was outstanding. These two chicks really belted it out last night. I had a really good time drinking here with my friend. They sell Heineken 22 oz bottles here. I thought that was pretty cool. My friend said ""Headband is the best"" about this place, I have no idea what the means though.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one!' which sets a very high positive bar. Despite a brief, awkward encounter with another patron, the review consistently highlights positive aspects and culminates in 'I had a really good time drinking here with my friend.'

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   First bar liked in Scottsdale.
    *   'A semblance of a normal crowd.'
    *   'Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing.'
    *   'the Karaoke was outstanding.'
    *   'These two chicks really belted it out last night.'
    *   'I had a really good time drinking here with my friend.'
    *   Sells Heineken 22 oz bottles, which the reviewer thought was 'pretty cool.'
    *   Friend's positive comment: 'Headband is the best'.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   An awkward interaction with 'some weirdo local chick' attempting 'some kind of bizarre swinger plot'. However, the reviewer states 'and they kicked rocks,' implying the interaction was resolved and didn't ruin the night. This is an issue with other patrons, not a direct complaint about the bar's service, drinks, or environment provided by the establishment itself.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is quite strong on the positive side: 'first one!', 'outstanding' (for karaoke), 'really good time'. The negative language ('weirdo', 'bizarre') is applied to a specific interaction with patrons, not the bar's quality, and is framed as something they moved past.

5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, absolutely. The opening statement alone (liking this bar when no others in Scottsdale had appealed to them) and the overall positive summary strongly indicate a recommendation.

6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the extreme contrast with other Scottsdale bars ('first one!'), the 'outstanding' karaoke, the 'really good time' had, and the fact that the only negative point was an isolated interaction with other customers that didn't detract from their overall enjoyment, this is a clear 5-star review. The positive elements are strong and numerous, outweighing the minor, customer-related hiccup.","```json

 Another testament to the quality of the food is the fact that on my most recent visit no fewer than three police officers stopped in for lunch. You don't get that kind of patronage unless you are everything that El Pollo Supremo is: cheap, fast, friendly, and delicious.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly very positive.

"In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus. 

After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste. 

Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. 

and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.

Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their ""famous"" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one! 

To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didn't work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! It's gonna be a blast!!",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, enthusiastic, and highly commendatory. The review begins and ends with strong praise and uses effusive language throughout.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Described as a 'foodie mecca' with 'plush and lux furnishings' and an 'amazing location.'
    *   Praised for 'on point entrees' and 'trendy lil touches.'
    *   The Pretzel and cheese fondue was 'yummy goodness' and tasted like 'cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste.'
    *   Musketeer #1's Shrimp Po' Boy was 'overwhelmingly awesome!' with 'fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping.'
    *   Miss Musketeer #3's Coq a Vin was a 'MUST!' and 'over all very good.'
    *   The 'famous' Monkey Bread was 'definately worth going bananas over!', described as 'Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet,' and the group 'died over that one!'
    *   The reviewer explicitly recommends the place for those who 'NEED to reach foodie nirvana' and concludes with 'It's gonna be a blast!!'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Musketeer #2's truffle egg scramble was 'good... not bad... but not terrific,' 'just missed something,' and called 'the low point in a overall great meal.'
    *   Miss Musketeer #3's Coq a Vin had 'an odd texture,' 'could have used a few more hours in the oven,' and was 'done... but barely.'
    *   Waiter was 'cooler-than-thou' and 'took a VERY long time t find him' for bread and butter.
    *   Outdoor heaters 'really didn't work' (minor).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language is extremely intense and hyperbolic ('foodie mecca,' 'overwhelmingly awesome!', 'a MUST!', 'worth going bananas over!', 'died over that one!', 'foodie nirvana,' 'It's gonna be a blast!!'). The negative language, while present, is less intense by comparison ('not terrific,' 'missed something,' 'odd texture,' 'done... but barely,' 'cooler-than-thou,' 'VERY long time'). The negatives are often framed within an 'overall great meal' or outweighed by overwhelming praise for other aspects.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Absolutely. The review is a clear and enthusiastic recommendation to 'yelpers,' explicitly stating 'this is the spot for you!' if certain conditions (cash, time, desire for 'foodie nirvana') are met.
6. **Star Rating:** Despite a few specific criticisms (one mediocre dish, one slightly undercooked main, slow service for one item), the overall tone, the effusive praise for multiple dishes and the ambiance, and the strong, explicit recommendation point overwhelmingly to a 5-star rating. The reviewer clearly 'loved' the experience, considering it a 'blast' and 'foodie nirvana,' indicating that the minor flaws did not significantly detract from their overall enjoyment and willingness to highly recommend it.","```json

as for appetizers, i love the signature Bloomin' onion and i recently tried their wings and i love them! it must be the seasonings and sauce
they taste very different.
and the service is alway excellent 
but when you do plan on going, make a reservation to avoid waiting too horribly long",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly very positive. The reviewer uses strong positive language throughout, expressing love for the place, food, specific dishes, and service.

    *   Loves the place and food.
    *   Prices are 'extremely reasonable now' allowing for more frequent visits.
    *   Steaks, ribs, and chicken are 'very good'.
    *   Loves the 'signature Bloomin' onion' and 'wings'.
    *   Notes unique and good taste for wings due to 'seasonings and sauce'.
    *   Service is 'alway excellent'.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** There are no direct negative aspects or complaints about the reviewer's personal experience.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly enthusiastic and strong: 'love this place', 'extremely reasonable', 'very good' (repeated), 'love them!' (repeated), 'alway excellent', 'very different' (in a positive context). The only somewhat negative phrase, 'too horribly long', is used in a cautionary, helpful context for future patrons, not as a complaint about a past experience.
5. **Would Recommend:** Absolutely. The review is a glowing endorsement, with practical advice indicating the place is popular and worth visiting.
6. **Predicted Rating:** Given the consistent and intense positive language for food, value, service, and the complete absence of any personal complaints, this review unequivocally warrants a 5-star rating.","```json

"Fun place to get masks for all my robberies.

"I have used The Parking Spot twice now, and am a registered card carrying member...lol. I have coworkers who use one of the other economy places across the street, but they don't get covered parking and I don't remember them being offered a complimentary news paper on entry and nice cool water when leaving. I get a government discount with ID and you can usually find a coupon online. Not to mention the prompt pick up. They are behind my vehicle ready for me and my luggage even before I am out of my car. There have been times when we wait for a few more people before we go to the airport, but never more than 10 or so min. I love not having to weave my way through the airport construction or get lost or delayed trying to park at the airport. 
When getting picked up the most I have had to wait was about 20 min. And as I was about ready to call, they showed up. Don't loose your ticket. I have seen others who have and it makes it really tough. You can pretty much expect to be the drivers last drop off, unless you remember where it is or see your car as others are getting dropped off. 

The entrance is just W. of 40th St. and can only be accessed when heading W. bound on Washington due to the light rail. But the website has some good directions as well.",4,5,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer highlights numerous benefits and expresses satisfaction with the service, comparing it favorably to competitors.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Loyal, registered customer (""card carrying member...lol"").
    *   Covered parking (a significant advantage over competitors).
    *   Complimentary newspaper and cool water.
    *   Government discount and online coupons available.
    *   Prompt airport shuttle pickup (often ready before the reviewer is out of the car).
    *   Short wait times for the shuttle *to* the airport (never more than 10 min).
    *   ""Love not having to weave my way through the airport construction or get lost or delayed trying to park at the airport"" (a major convenience benefit).
    *   Website has good directions for a tricky entrance.
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Waiting for pickup *from* the airport: ""the most I have had to wait was about 20 min. And as I was about ready to call, they showed up."" (This is presented factually and resolved, not as a strong complaint).
    *   Warning not to lose the ticket, as it ""makes it really tough"" for others.
    *   Expectation that one might be the ""driver's last drop off"" when returning to one's car.
    *   Tricky entrance access due to light rail, but mitigated by good website directions.
4.  **Intensity of language used:**
    *   **Positive:** Uses phrases like ""card carrying member...lol"" (indicating loyalty and mild humor), ""don't get covered parking"" (highlighting a key advantage), ""complimentary,"" ""nice cool water,"" ""prompt pick up,"" ""even before I am out of my car,"" and most tellingly, ""I love not having to weave my way through the airport construction."" The positive language is strong and heartfelt.
    *   **Negative:** The language used for perceived negatives is much softer and more factual or cautionary. ""Most I have had to wait was about 20 min."" is a statement of fact, not a complaint. ""Makes it really tough"" is a warning about lost tickets, not a flaw in service. ""Pretty much expect to be the drivers last drop off"" is setting an expectation, not expressing frustration.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely. The reviewer is a repeat customer, highly satisfied with multiple aspects of the service, and explicitly compares it favorably to alternatives. The minor inconveniences mentioned are framed as expectations or helpful tips, not reasons to avoid the service.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming number of positive experiences, the expressed loyalty, the strong emotional language (e.g., ""I love""), and the fact that the 'negatives' are either minor, resolved, or presented as helpful warnings rather than complaints, a 5-star rating is clearly warranted. The reviewer sees significant value and convenience.","```json

"I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day.

"Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepeño - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!

As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. While there is a significant complaint at the end, the bulk of the review expresses strong enjoyment and satisfaction with the venue's core offerings.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer highlights a 'Fun Saturday night music venue,' 'good food & beer for only a few $,' 'fun music and tunes everyone knows,' 'delicious $1 carne asada tacos,' and observes 'lucious burgers.' Most importantly, they explicitly state, 'Will definitely be back!'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaint is about the lack of adherence to the 50ft non-smoking rule at outdoor venues, and a general frustration with smokers not considering others, particularly as a non-smoking asthmatic. The reviewer perceives this as a common issue ('As with any outside venue,' 'As seems to be the norm').
4. **Intensity of language used:** The positive language is very strong: 'Fun,' 'good,' 'delicious!', 'lucious,' 'definitely be back!' (with an exclamation mark). The negative language expresses frustration and disappointment ('appreciate adherence,' 'non-poluters,' 'only care about smoking,' 'think of others occasionally please'), but it's directed more at the general issue of smoking at outdoor venues and patron behavior, rather than a direct indictment of the venue's core service or a truly 'ruined' experience.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Yes, unequivocally. The statement 'Will definitely be back!' is a clear and strong recommendation, indicating that despite the negative experience with smoking, the positive aspects of the venue greatly outweigh it for the reviewer.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The enthusiastic praise for the food, music, value, and the explicit, strong intent to return ('Will definitely be back!') strongly indicate a 5-star rating. While the smoking complaint is significant for the reviewer and clearly bothered them, it is presented more as a plea for improvement on a common issue at outdoor venues, rather than a fundamental flaw that detracted from their overall enjoyment of the *venue itself* to the point of reducing its star rating. The core offerings are presented as excellent and highly valued.","```json

"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** Very positive. The reviewer uses highly descriptive and enthusiastic language throughout, appreciating the unique theme, decor, food, and overall experience.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Successfully 'nailed' the gringo bar in Mexico replication.
    *   The building/decor is a 'spectacle' (bright colors, indoor/outdoor, multiple bars, games, sports, music, Elvis room, Chuck Norris jokes, drink specials).
    *   Clever and 'genius' directional floor markings (blue footprints to men's room, dollar signs to ATM).
    *   The idea of a 'killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar' (even if slightly delayed).
    *   Acceptance of their late opening for brunch ('okay in my book').
    *   Great value for all-you-can-eat brunch ($10).
    *   Good variety of brunch food ('eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff').
    *   Enjoyable ambiance for brunch ('sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz').
    *   Preferred experience over local traffic/church.
    *   Tranquil on Sunday morning, meeting a specific need.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   The only minor point was that they weren't open at 10:30 AM for brunch, but this was immediately mitigated and accepted by the reviewer ('okay in my book'). There are no actual complaints about the quality of the food, service, or atmosphere once they were open.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is consistently strong and positive: 'absolutely nailed,' 'spectacle,' 'genius stuff, really,' 'killer Sunday brunch,' 'has the balls to wait,' 'nothing like sitting out in the sun,' 'tranquil as the doctor ordered.' The reviewer's tone is enthusiastic, appreciative, and often humorous, indicating a very enjoyable experience.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, unequivocally. The review reads as a highly enthusiastic endorsement, detailing numerous reasons why someone should visit and what they can expect to enjoy.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming positivity, the enthusiastic and detailed description of numerous positive aspects, the complete lack of any significant complaints, and the reviewer's clear enjoyment and appreciation for the establishment's unique character, a 5-star rating is the most appropriate.","```json

"There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupe's: First off, you have to understand that it's not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, it's not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the ""waiter"", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the ""bus boys"". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is. 

Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I can't get enough of their enchilada's. If you're lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapilla's??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal. 

Like I said, you have to understand what you're getting into with Frank and Lupe's and if you can look past a few of their shortcomings, the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. While the review starts by listing 'considerations' and 'shortcomings,' it quickly shifts to effusive praise for the food and explicitly concludes that the place is 'some of the best in town' despite its minor flaws.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The reviewer raves about the food, calling it 'TAST-TEE!' and expressing an inability to 'get enough' of their enchiladas. Specific dishes like the Poblano Chile enchiladas and chicken mole enchilada plate are described as 'amazing' and 'incredibly delicious.' The sopapillas evoke an extremely enthusiastic response ('WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?!'). The atmosphere and prices are also highlighted as 'some of the best in town.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects/Complaints:** The reviewer notes that the food is 'not GREAT Mexican food' in a high-quality sense, but immediately reframes it as 'more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house,' which can be endearing. Service is described as 'somewhat spotty,' with the waiter disappearing and busboys handling service, making 'Getting the check... the hardest thing.'
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language used for positives is highly intense and enthusiastic (e.g., 'TAST-TEE!', 'amazing,' 'incredibly delicious,' capitalized 'WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?!', 'some of the best in town!'). The negative language is more moderate ('not GREAT,' 'somewhat spotty,' 'hardest thing') and often tempered or presented as something to 'understand' or 'look past.'
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Yes, unequivocally. The concluding sentence explicitly states: 'if you can look past a few of their shortcomings, the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!' This is a strong recommendation for anyone willing to accept its quirks.
6. **Star Rating Justification:** Despite the initial 'considerations,' the intensity of the positive language, the specific glowing praise for multiple dishes, and the final declaration that the place offers 'some of the best in town' for food, atmosphere, and prices, strongly indicate a top-tier experience for the reviewer. The 'shortcomings' are presented as minor hurdles that are easily overcome by the exceptional positives. A reviewer who says 'WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?' about a dish is having a 5-star experience, even if getting the check is a minor hassle.","```json

"My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive.

"Shame on me for not writing a review sooner.  Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about 2 months prior as well.  We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. 

As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. 

We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. 

I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer starts by expressing regret for not writing sooner, indicating a very good experience they wanted to share. They use positive language throughout and explicitly state their intention to return.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:** The reviewer highlights numerous positive aspects: a vibrant, packed atmosphere; a 'huge highlight' of seeing Muhammed Ali; rich sports memorabilia; delicious food (10 oz ribeye was 'delicious,' mac and cheese had 'lots of flavor'); a fun sporting atmosphere; and convenient walkability from Downtown Scottsdale. They also note the popularity requiring early reservations.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The only 'odd thing' mentioned was the waitress suggesting they walk over to see the Brewers Manager. The reviewer immediately counters this by stating 'even I know the limits of someone's personal space,' indicating it was a minor lapse in judgment on the waitress's part, but not something that significantly detracted from their overall positive experience. It was not a complaint about the food, service quality (otherwise), or general ambiance.

"It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.

I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.

"Awesome Donuts! 

The only thing is, I was expecting the light fluffy glazed that Krispy Kreme has. This is not the same. HOWEVER these donuts are homemade delicious and why not support small businesses?!?! 

So why the 4/5 star instead of 5/5? Well the majority of our group LOVED the donuts and swears by them. HOWEVER, one or two just thought they were alright and preferred a light airy donut a la Krispy Kreme (lameeee). So thats why I am trying to represent all opinions here in my reviews.

We were headed there when they were closing the dining room apparently (the drive thru is 24 hours though), but the nice lady allowed us to come inside, we had a rather large group with us. 

THE BUTTERMILK donut is amazing!! TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!

These donuts taste fresh, delicious, and the customer service was so great when we were there that night. This place is the best donut place I have been to in AZ. No more KKreme or DDonuts (that place is not that good anyway).

The review starts with 'Awesome Donuts!' and ends with a strong recommendation, calling it 'the best donut place' in AZ.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** 'Awesome Donuts!', 'homemade delicious', 'support small businesses', 'majority of our group LOVED the donuts', 'swears by them', 'nice lady allowed us to come inside' (despite closing time), 'THE BUTTERMILK donut is amazing!!', 'TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!', 'taste fresh, delicious', 'customer service was so great', 'This place is the best donut place I have been to in AZ.', 'No more KKreme or DDonuts', 'Just go to Bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary 'negative' is an expectation mismatch with Krispy Kreme's light fluffy glazed style, which the reviewer notes 'is not the same.' They also mention that 'one or two' members of their group thought the donuts were 'alright' and preferred the lighter style (which the reviewer calls 'lameeee'). There's a minor note about the dining room closing, but this is immediately mitigated by positive customer service.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The positive language is extremely strong and frequent: 'Awesome,' 'homemade delicious,' 'LOVED,' 'swears by them,' 'amazing!!', 'TOTALLY worth,' 'fresh, delicious,' 'so great,' 'best donut place,' 'never go to a chain donut shop again.' The 'negative' language is much milder ('not the same,' 'alright') and often downplayed or immediately followed by praise (e.g., calling the dissenting opinion 'lameeee').
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place:** Absolutely. The reviewer states, 'Just go to Bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again,' which is a very strong and direct recommendation.
6. **Predicted Stars:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'So why the 4/5 star instead of 5/5? Well the majority of our group LOVED the donuts and swears by them. HOWEVER, one or two just thought they were alright and preferred a light airy donut a la Krispy Kreme (lameeee). So thats why I am trying to represent all opinions here in my reviews.'

"Brackin's is my new favorite day drinking spot.  The bar itself is located perfectly within a tucked-away area in the Old Town Scottsdale mall area.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, and when the owners swing by, they really make an effort to get to know you.  Prices are also very relaxed, with bottled beer landing right around $3 for domestics.

"Was not satisfied first trip, service was awful and place was deafening.  But we thought food was worth trying again.  So, now that the place has been open and matured it is much better.  Our sever was good, the place was about 1/2 empty which made the noise level much more bearable.
Food, very good.  Not chicago family run good, but for the valley very good.
I asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was.  Hsb can't handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested.  The mustard wraps, unusual and tasty.  Hsb loved the peanut sauce.  Chicken and lemongrass salad, good flavors.  We will be back.",4,4,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The review starts with a very negative sentiment regarding the 'first trip' ('awful' service, 'deafening' place). However, the vast majority of the review, and its conclusion, is overwhelmingly positive about the *current* experience. The reviewer highlights significant improvements, detailed positive aspects of the food and service, and expresses a clear intent to return. The dominant sentiment is strongly positive for the current visit.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Place has 'matured' and is 'much better'.
    *   Server was 'good'.
    *   Noise level was 'much more bearable' (due to being 1/2 empty).
    *   Food was rated 'very good' ('for the valley very good').
    *   Shrimp was spicy as requested.
    *   Curried duck was mild as requested.
    *   Mustard wraps were 'unusual and tasty'.
    *   Husband 'loved' the peanut sauce.
    *   Chicken and lemongrass salad had 'good flavors'.
    *   Explicit statement: 'We will be back.'
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   First trip: Service was 'awful' and the place was 'deafening'. (These are about a past visit, not the current one).
    *   Minor/Implicit for current: The noise level was only 'bearable' because the place was 1/2 empty, implying it might still be an issue when busy. The food, while 'very good for the valley,' was 'not Chicago family run good,' which is a slight comparative caveat.
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language for the first trip was strongly negative ('awful,' 'deafening'). However, the language for the current trip is strongly positive and descriptive: 'much better,' 'good,' 'much more bearable,' 'very good,' 'spicy and it was,' 'mild as requested,' 'unusual and tasty,' 'loved,' 'good flavors,' and the conclusive 'We will be back.' The positive language is more detailed and persuasive.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, unequivocally. The statement 'We will be back' is a direct and strong indication of a recommendation and high satisfaction.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** While the review starts with a very negative first experience, it focuses on a successful transformation and a highly positive current visit. The improvements in service and ambiance are noted, and the food receives extensive and specific praise, including accommodating dietary preferences. The strong intent to return signifies high satisfaction. The only minor caveats are the noise level being 'bearable' due to low occupancy and the 'not Chicago good' comparison for food. These minor points prevent a perfect 5-star rating, but the overwhelming positive details and explicit future patronage strongly warrant a 4-star rating, signifying a very good experience that the reviewer highly recommends despite past issues.","```json

"I don't know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on.

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer starts with a declaration of love for the store and maintains an enthusiastic, appreciative tone throughout.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The reviewer praises the wide and random selection of goods (fabric, chairs, tabletops, flooring, tiles), the 'family-run vibe,' exceptional customer service (owner Alan's generosity with free sublayment, staff helping with projects), and the welcoming atmosphere for amateurs. They explicitly state that Tempe Sales 'is great' and that the 'downsides' actually 'make the experience more interesting.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** Only minor points are mentioned: bamboo flooring is 'sadly no longer in stock,' 'stock levels are not always reliable,' and the store was 'historically been disorganized.' However, each of these is immediately mitigated or reframed; the disorganization is 'much better now than in the past,' and unreliable stock is presented as contributing to an 'interesting' experience.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly positive and enthusiastic: 'how can you not love them?', 'makes Tempe Sales great,' 'threw in plenty...for free,' 'no shame in being an amateur,' and a strong call to action to 'do yourself a favor and check it out.' The mild 'downsides' are described in a way that minimizes their negative impact.

"I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldn't let her drink alone. And oh, I'm so glad I'm such a good friend. 

The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing. And plenty strong enough to make any hour happy. This drink defines the word elixir. It is as intoxicatingly unforgettable as its namesake.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** Very positive.

"As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had! I would much rather come here than IHOP",4,4,"Step 1: Overall sentiment is decidedly positive. The reviewer identifies a significant pain point for parents (finding comfortable, casual, kid-friendly dining without judgment) and implies this restaurant successfully addresses it. The food is consistently described as 'good' and 'pretty good' and 'inexpensive,' with the french fries singled out for exceptional praise. The final comparison to IHOP is a strong endorsement.

Step 2: Specific positive aspects mentioned include: being 'very comfortable and casual,' a place where 'people don't give you evil looks and comments for bringing kids,' food has 'always been good,' 'pretty good,' 'inexpensive,' and 'their french fries are some of the best I've had!' The reviewer also states, 'I would much rather come here than IHOP.'

Step 3: The only specific negative aspect or complaint is 'Not great' in reference to the general food quality. However, this is immediately qualified by 'but pretty good,' which softens the impact considerably and suggests it's more of a nuanced observation than a serious complaint.

Step 4: The intensity of language is moderate to strong positive. Phrases like 'very difficult to find' highlight the value of this restaurant. 'Evil looks and comments' from *other* places emphasizes the comfort found here. 'Always been good' indicates consistency. 'Some of the best I've had!' is very strong praise for the fries. 'Much rather come here than IHOP' is a clear and strong preference.

Step 5: Yes, the reviewer would clearly recommend this place. They present it as a solution to a common problem, highlight its consistent positive attributes, and explicitly state a preference for it over an alternative.

Step 6: Based on all factors, a 4-star rating is appropriate. While the general food isn't described as 'great,' it's consistently 'good' and 'pretty good,' and importantly, 'inexpensive.' The restaurant excels in providing a comfortable, kid-friendly environment, which is a major draw for the reviewer. The french fries receive exceptionally high praise ('some of the best'). The overall positive sentiment, problem-solving nature, and strong preference over a competitor push it well beyond average (3 stars) into the 'very good' category, even if it doesn't quite reach 'outstanding' (5 stars) due to the general food not being 'great.'","```json

"Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza, or at least pizza that I'm accustomed to.  Rosati's, while not quite what I'm used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that I've found.  

The Chicago style deep dish is good.  The toppings, especially the sausage, are plentiful and tasty and the sauce is good.  I think the crust is what is a bit off.  

Overall, Rosati's is still my choice for pizza in the valley.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is positive. While the reviewer notes Phoenix's limited good pizza options and mentions Rosati's isn't *exactly* what they're used to, they ultimately declare it the 'best representation' they've found and their 'choice for pizza in the valley.'
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Best representation of Chicago style pizza found in Phoenix.
    *   Chicago style deep dish is 'good'.
    *   Toppings (especially sausage) are 'plentiful and tasty'.
    *   Sauce is 'good'.
    *   'Still my choice for pizza in the valley.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   'Not quite what I'm used to' (minor, comparative reservation).
    *   'The crust is what is a bit off.' (Specific, mild complaint).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is generally positive ('best representation', 'good', 'plentiful and tasty', 'still my choice'). The negatives are phrased mildly ('not quite what I'm used to', 'a bit off'). The concluding statement 'still my choice' is very strong and definitive.
5. **Would Recommend:** Yes, the reviewer would definitely recommend this place, explicitly stating it's their top choice for pizza in the area.
6. **Assigned Rating:** A 4-star rating is appropriate. Despite a minor flaw with the crust and the caveat that it's not *exactly* what they're used to, the overwhelming positive feedback, the declaration of it being the 'best representation' in the area, and their 'choice for pizza' clearly indicate a rating above average (3 stars). It's not a perfect 5-star experience due to the identified flaw and the initial 'not quite what I'm used to' comment, but it's a strong positive endorsement.","```json

"the things I liked:

the cart.
 it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.)
You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Fry's, and its a bummer.
Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason.
the steering on the carts was easy like ikea's carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver.

The food.
Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked. 
I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss)
They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or don't, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff.
It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store.

Last grabs.
If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever.

One of these things is not like the other...
so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheeto's? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have?

They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX)

$.
Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same. 
they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce.

you will definitely see me there again.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer dedicates extensive detail to 'things I liked,' with only a few very minor critiques, many of which are either observations rather than complaints or were addressed by later updates. The concluding sentence seals the positive tone.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   **Carts:** Praises the original small carts (fit baby carrier), cleanliness ('cleanest they will ever be'), and easy steering. Even though small carts are gone, the *experience* with them was positive, and cleanliness/steering remain.
    *   **Food:** Appreciates minimal marketing (focus on quality), simplified decision-making (1-2 brands per item), and how this leads to buying less and a shorter, more efficient shopping trip.
    *   **Convenience:** Notes useful 'last grabs' like pharmacy, pet food, and baby care.
    *   **Pricing/Value:** Highlights some items being cheaper, and strongly praises the proactive discounting of items close to expiration (milk, baked goods, meat, produce) for both value and convenience.
    *   **Updates:** The updates specifically note that AMEX is now accepted (resolving an initial negative) and that the small carts are gone (a minor loss, but the other cart positives stand).
    *   **Recommendation:** Explicitly states, 'you will definitely see me there again,' which is a strong endorsement.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   **Carts:** The update 'they got rid of the small carts' implies a loss of a liked feature, but it's not a complaint about the current carts being bad, just a change.
    *   **Prepared Food:** Update 'Prepared food is kinda hit or miss' is a mild negative, but for a specific category within 'The food.'
    *   **Chip Aisle:** A slightly sarcastic observation about Flaming Hot Cheetos, suggesting limited variety for some specific brands, but it's very minor and not a strong complaint.
    *   **Coupons:** A practical warning about 'fine print on the coupons,' which is a tip rather than a condemnation of the store itself.
    *   **AMEX:** Initially a negative, but the *update* indicates it's no longer an issue, effectively turning it into a neutral or even positive point now.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly positive ('much smaller,' 'somehow our baby carrier fit,' 'cleanest they will ever be,' 'easy like ikea's carts,' 'minimal marketing which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality,' 'makes decisions easy,' 'shorter trip,' 'definitely see me there again'). Negative language is minimal and low in intensity ('kinda hit or miss,' 'maybe thats the part where they sell local goods,' 'watch out').
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, absolutely. The explicit statement 'you will definitely see me there again' is a clear and strong recommendation.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming number of detailed positive points, the enthusiasm, the resolution of an initial negative (AMEX), the very mild and few complaints, and the explicit intent to return, this review strongly indicates a 5-star experience.","```json

"I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.",4,3,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The reviewer explicitly states 'mixed feelings' and uses phrases like 'somewhat overrated' and 'expected more for the price.' However, they also use 'absolutely phenomenal' for common areas and 'very nice' for the balcony. The concluding paragraph suggests it 'fits the bill' for a 'reasonably nice hotel' with good location, but tempers expectations for the room. The sentiment is generally neutral to slightly disappointed due to value, despite significant positive aspects. 
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Lobby and grounds are 'absolutely phenomenal.'
    *   They are 'stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious.'
    *   The deck/balcony area was 'very nice.'
    *   Able to study in the fresh air without distractions on the balcony.
    *   Close to everything (location).
    *   Overall described as a 'reasonably nice hotel.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   'Mixed feelings.'
    *   'Somewhat overrated.'
    *   'For the price I paid, I expected more' (value complaint).
    *   Resort layout is more like an 'apartment complex.'
    *   Room was 'a little bit less impressive.'
    *   Room had 'nothing extra.'

    *   Linens were 'just average.'
    *   TV was 'small.'
    *   Room wasn't 'nearly as glorious as the common areas.'
    *   Rooms are 'average. Nothing less, nothing more.'
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language for positive aspects ('absolutely phenomenal,' 'luxurious,' 'very nice') is strong. The negative language for the room ('a little bit less impressive,' 'just average,' 'small') is milder, but the 'somewhat overrated' and 'expected more for the price' are strong indicators of disappointment regarding value and overall perception. The repeated use of 'average' for the room is a clear, neutral-to-negative descriptor.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place:** The reviewer provides a conditional recommendation: 'If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill.' This is tempered by a strong caveat: 'However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room.' This is not an enthusiastic recommendation, but it's also not a 'do not recommend.'
6. **Assigned Rating:** 3 stars. The review balances extremely positive comments about common areas and location ('phenomenal,' 'close to everything') against significant disappointment regarding value for money ('expected more for the price,' 'somewhat overrated') and the explicitly 'average' quality of the room. A 3-star rating aligns well with 'mixed feelings' and an experience that is 'reasonably nice' but ultimately didn't meet expectations for its price point, leading to an overall average impression despite highlights.","```json

"Okay, eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird.  But after getting off of long flights, my mother and I needed some kind of Asian food and quick.  The GPS was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears.

I give these guys major kudos for the portion size.  Seriously, I felt like I was still in Texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me.  And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and they didn't skimp on the meat.  My mom's soup had to be improvised since they'd run out of octopus.  They asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter.  Sure, it was tasty, but she was really disappointed.  The fried spring rolls were okay, but they were tiny and not piping hot.

This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot.  It came out quickly and the service was quite friendly (though not quite professional).  I'm all about supporting the mom-and-pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents, I feel for them even more (been there, done that).  With a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel, this place will continue to attract more and more clients.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is positive. While there are some initial quirks and minor disappointments, the reviewer expresses strong satisfaction with their own meal, appreciates the service, and shows a supportive stance towards the business.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Major kudos for enormous portion sizes (specifically Pad Thai).
    *   Pad Thai was ""delicious"" (plenty of peanuts, perfectly cooked noodles, didn't skimp on meat).
    *   Mother's improvised soup was ""tasty.""

    *   Supports ""mom-and-pop shops"" and acknowledges kids working for parents.
    *   Believes the place ""will continue to attract more and more clients.""

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Ambiance: ""eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird.""
    *   Ingredient availability: They ""run out of octopus"" for mother's soup.
    *   Mother's disappointment: Despite the improvised soup being tasty, she was ""really disappointed"" about the missing octopus.
    *   Fried spring rolls: ""were okay,"" but ""tiny"" and ""not piping hot.""
    *   Service: ""not quite professional"" (though balanced with ""quite friendly"").
    *   Suggestions for improvement: ""better parking lot"" and ""remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel.""

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language is quite strong (""major kudos,"" ""enormous,"" ""delicious,"" ""perfectly cooked,"" ""hit the spot""). The negative language is generally mild to moderate (""kinda weird,"" ""okay,"" ""tiny,"" ""not piping hot""). The strongest negative feeling expressed is the mother being ""really disappointed,"" but this was due to an ingredient unavailability, not a fault in the preparation of the dish she received.

5. **Would Recommend:** Yes, the reviewer would recommend this place. Despite the minor issues, the overall experience was positive (""food hit the spot,"" ""nice way to start our trip""), and the reviewer explicitly states support for the business, believing it will continue to attract customers if it makes some improvements.

6. **Star Rating:** Combining all factors, a 4-star rating is appropriate. The excellent main dish (Pad Thai), generous portions, quick, friendly service, and supportive tone outweigh the minor complaints about the ambiance, the mother's disappointment (which was handled with an alternative, albeit not preferred, option), and the mediocre spring rolls.

"Yes, I am a fan. Particularly of the brunches! They bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good. The King's cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter (which I'm personally not a fan of). The portions are very very generous. On a nice day, the patio is great. Comfy seats, evap cooler outside, misting system. Most people don't know about their brunches I assume, since the entire place was empty when we were there at 10am. The dinners are great as well. The pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good! It definitely has a commercial feel to it, but I believe it's a local business which I'm all for.",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states, 'Yes, I am a fan' at the beginning and ends by saying 'I'm all for' the local business. The language throughout is enthusiastic and complimentary.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Reviewer is 'a fan,' particularly of the brunches.
    *   Baked pancakes are 'ooooh so good.'
    *   King's cakes are 'delicious' with bananas and chocolate.
    *   Portions are 'very very generous.'
    *   Patio is 'great' with 'comfy seats, evap cooler outside, misting system.'
    *   Dinners are 'great as well.'
    *   Pulled pork sandwich and pizzas are 'surprisingly good!'
    *   Supports the business because it's local ('I'm all for').
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   'Served with peanut butter (which I'm personally not a fan of)' - This is a very minor, subjective personal preference for an accompaniment, not a criticism of the food quality itself or the establishment.
    *   'The entire place was empty when we were there at 10am' - This is an observation, possibly a lament, but not a complaint about their experience or the service.
    *   'It definitely has a commercial feel to it' - This is a mild aesthetic observation, immediately mitigated and overridden by the positive sentiment towards it being a local business ('but I believe it's a local business which I'm all for').
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly positive and enthusiastic: 'a fan,' 'ooooh so good,' 'delicious,' 'very very generous,' 'great' (repeatedly), 'surprisingly good!', 'I'm all for.' The 'negatives' are expressed in very mild or subjective terms ('personally not a fan,' 'commercial feel').
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely. The review is essentially a strong endorsement, encouraging others to discover their brunches and praising multiple aspects of their food and ambiance. The reviewer sounds like a repeat customer and a promoter.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming positive sentiment, the numerous glowing descriptions, the enthusiastic language, and the almost non-existent true complaints (the 'negatives' are minor subjective points or observations quickly dismissed), this review unequivocally warrants a 5-star rating.","```json

The review is essentially a strong endorsement, encouraging others to discover their brunches and praising multiple aspects of their food and ambiance. The reviewer sounds like a repeat customer and a promoter.\n6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming positive sentiment, the numerous glowing descriptions, the enthusiastic language, and the almost non-existent true complaints (the 'negatives' are minor subjective points or observations quickly dismissed), this review unequivocally warrants a 5-star rating.""

"Headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he's lived in Phx for decades and recommended this place (although he hadn't been there in many years). I got a Super Sicilian. Absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty. If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the ""all-American grinder"" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos. Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!

PS: Parking? The boss just parked his Ram 2500HD and toy trailer around the corner on the street in front of someone's house. No problem and no parking meters. (shrug)",4,5,"1. **Overall sentiment**: The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states the food was 'Absolutely delicious' and declares a clear intent to 'definitely return'.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned**: The sandwich (Super Sicilian) was 'Absolutely delicious'. The bread was 'soft and tasty' despite its appearance. The reviewer 'will definitely return here'. Parking was easy ('No problem and no parking meters').
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints**: The sandwich inexplicably took 'something like 10 mins to make'. The sandwich was 'too small', though the reviewer immediately follows this with '*8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those,' taking responsibility and suggesting it wasn't a severe issue. A minor comparison to a competitor (Uncle Sam's) noted the lack of jalapenos here.
4. **Intensity of language used**: The positive language is very strong ('Absolutely delicious', 'will definitely return'). The negative language is mild and framed softly ('If I had to offer up any criticisms...', 'inexplicably took something like 10 mins'). The self-correction and emoticon (*8-)) for the portion size complaint further diminish its intensity. The criticisms are presented as almost an obligation to find something wrong, rather than genuine grievances.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place**: Yes, the reviewer explicitly states, 'Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!' This is a strong, unequivocal recommendation and intent to become a repeat customer.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars**: The core experience (food taste) was 'Absolutely delicious'. The intent to 'definitely return' and plan for future orders signifies a highly satisfactory experience. The criticisms are minor, framed lightly, and one is largely self-attributed. The ease of parking is an added bonus. All indicators point to a top-tier rating.","```json

"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. While there are a couple of very minor critiques regarding specific pastry components, these are quickly overshadowed by effusive praise for the service, value, and general product quality, culminating in a strong desire to return.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Very clean establishment.
    *   Exceptional customer service from Miguel: he greeted the reviewer, clearly explained items, was very friendly, patient, conversational, and passionate about his business and Yelp.
    *   Outstanding value: 10 pastries for $6.80 is described as 'What a great deal!'
    *   High anticipation for other menu items like burritos and tamales, with positive mention of homemade tortillas.
    *   The pineapple pastry was 'curvy, pretty looking' and 'just fine' with the filling, leading to 'drooling.'
    *   The caramel flautas, after an initial mild reaction, received a 'WOW!' and 'I LOVE IT!!!' becoming a 'definitely must have' despite the reviewer not being a big fan of caramel.
    *   Strong intent to return and try more items ('must come back,' 'can't wait till tomorrow morning').

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Burritos were not ready yet (an inconvenience, not a quality complaint).
    *   The Bavarian cream in one pastry 'wasn't as creamy than I'm used to' and the reviewer 'almost thought it would have been better off to not have it,' but then immediately mitigated by saying 'it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together.'
    *   The first two bites of the caramel flautas were 'eh' and 'um,' but this was completely resolved and then reversed into extreme praise.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly enthusiastic and expressive for positive aspects ('very clean,' 'great deal!', 'very friendly,' 'lots of patience,' 'WOW!', 'I LOVE IT!!!', 'just so good!', 'definitely must have,' 'can't wait,' 'excuse me as I wipe my drool'). The 'negative' language is very mild ('wasn't as creamy,' 'eh,' 'um') and quickly mitigated or turned around.

5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place?** Absolutely. The reviewer explicitly states, 'So...I must come back and try it' and 'A definitely must have for next time,' and 'I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.' This indicates a strong recommendation and intent for repeat business.

6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelmingly positive sentiment, exceptional service, great value, high praise for most items (especially the 'WOW!' moment with the flautas), and explicit intent for multiple return visits, this review clearly warrants a 5-star rating. The minor critiques are presented more as observations than serious complaints that would detract from a stellar experience.","```json

"This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat.
   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.",4,5,"Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer champions the unique character, cultural experience, and specific high-quality products of Tony's, despite acknowledging its imperfections.

2.  **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Acknowledges and builds upon other positive reviews.
    *   Praises it as a 'cultural experience' and a 'bona-fide living history museum' with three generations of family service.
    *   Appreciates the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products, noting the 'faded, festive charm' and 'palpable sense of eras past, and present.'
    *   Finds the sliced meats and cheeses 'very good, and well priced.'
    *   'Seconds' votes for the subs.
    *   Calls the traditional cannoli a 'bargain.'
    *   Considers bulk olives a 'bargain.'
    *   Provides an extremely effusive, poetic, and lengthy description of the 'sublime,' 'addicting,' and 'delicious' Sicilian olives, strongly recommending them ('Try at least ONE in your lifetime').

3.  **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Cleanliness: Describes Tony's as operating on a 'European Standard,' implying it's not pristine, and acknowledges 'there IS dust.' However, the reviewer explicitly defends this, reframing it as part of the charm and challenging those who might be overly concerned with hygiene.
    *   Doesn't 'especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage.' (A personal preference, not a major complaint).
    *   Recommends checking 'expire dates on groceries' due to unknown turnover, noting it 'happens' everywhere.
    *   Mentions that Sicilian olives 'skips the minced garlic more often than not,' but provides a solution (add your own).

4.  **Intensity of Language Used:** The positive language is exceptionally intense, particularly when describing the atmosphere ('living history museum,' 'faded, festive charm') and the Sicilian olives (numerous highly descriptive, sensory adjectives, culminating in 'sublime' and 'addicting,' with a call to action: 'Try at least ONE in your lifetime'). The negative language, by contrast, is very muted and often framed as a mild caveat or a personal preference, rather than a strong complaint from the reviewer's perspective. The reviewer actively defends the 'flaws' like cleanliness.

5.  **Would the Reviewer Recommend This Place?** Absolutely, and with great enthusiasm. The reviewer directly encourages people to 'at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience.' The passionate description of the olives is a clear call for others to try them. Even the practical advice (checking expiration dates) is given in the context of someone who expects others to visit and make purchases.

6.  **Assigned Rating:** 5 stars. Despite acknowledging some imperfections (which are often defended or downplayed by the reviewer), the overwhelming sentiment is one of deep appreciation and passion for Tony's. The reviewer champions its unique character, cultural value, and specific delicious items with exceptionally strong, recommending language. The minor negatives are presented as acceptable quirks for an establishment that offers such a rich and authentic experience. The reviewer clearly loves the place for what it is and urges others to embrace it.","```json

"I ate so many samples, I downsized my order! Some selections are a little too sweet for me, but others--giarduia, vanilla, pistachio, that dark chocolate stuff--are really good! We rode our bikes there at night. Made up for the calories. You've gotta have a little wholesome, yummy sweetness in life now and then. OK, it's not Anderson's Frozen Custard, but it's fine for Chandler.",4,4,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is strongly positive, despite a few minor caveats. Phrases like 'really good!', 'wholesome, yummy sweetness' dominate the review.
2.  **Specific positive aspects:**
    *   Generous samples ('ate so many samples, I downsized my order!').
    *   Specific flavors are 'really good!' (giarduia, vanilla, pistachio, dark chocolate stuff).
    *   The product is described as 'wholesome, yummy sweetness'.
    *   The reviewer enjoyed the experience enough to bike there ('made up for the calories'), implying it was worth the effort.
    *   Philosophical endorsement of enjoying such treats ('You've gotta have a little wholesome, yummy sweetness in life').
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   'Some selections are a little too sweet for me' (a personal preference, not a categorical condemnation).
    *   'OK, it's not Anderson's Frozen Custard' (a comparison to a perceived higher standard, implying it's not the absolute best).
4.  **Intensity of language:** The positive language is quite strong ('really good!', 'yummy sweetness'). The negative language is mild and qualified ('a little too sweet for me', 'not Anderson's but it's fine'). 'Fine for Chandler' is a mild positive, indicating acceptability and enjoyment within its local context.
5.  **Recommendation:** The reviewer would likely recommend this place. Despite the comparison to Anderson's, the overall enjoyment, the praise for specific flavors, and the general sentiment suggest a positive recommendation, especially for someone in Chandler looking for a treat.
6.  **Predicted rating:** The strong positive elements ('really good', 'yummy sweetness', generous samples, worth the bike ride) significantly outweigh the mild, subjective negatives ('a little too sweet for me', 'not Anderson's'). It's clearly better than average (3 stars) but the comparison to a gold standard prevents it from being a perfect 5.

"I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyro's, but now I can't get enough!

I don't go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak, rice, pinto beans, and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu, but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time I'll try something other than the chicken - since it's super bland.

The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is), just step outside, place a phone order, then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order, because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  I've made an order with my iPhone twice now, and it couldn't be easier.

The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time, from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor.",4,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses strong enjoyment of Chipotle after an initial dislike, praises specific aspects highly, and frequents the establishment. Despite mentioning a couple of drawbacks, the tone remains enthusiastic.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Initially disliked, but now ""can't get enough!""

"What a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown Phoenix.  Sitting outside on an April afternoon, listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze (thanks to the misters), I felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I really dug the atmosphere, and the food was delicious.  The Vegetarian Omelet was yummy, bursting with veggies, and the olives gave it a great flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted.  I also had a few bites of the Banana Fosters French Toast, which is waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal.  The coffee is good enough to drink black.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses strong, evocative language to describe a delightful experience from start to finish.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Beautiful brunch oasis and atmosphere (jazz, cool breeze, misters, Mediterranean feel).
    *   Food was 'delicious'.
    *   Vegetarian Omelet: 'yummy', 'bursting with veggies', 'great flavor' from olives.
    *   Potatoes: 'perfectly cooked and seasoned'.
    *   Whole wheat bread: 'thick and perfectly toasted'.
    *   Banana Fosters French Toast: described as a 'great finish to my meal' (despite a personal sweetness preference).
    *   Coffee: 'good enough to drink black'.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** The only mention that could be perceived as negative is the Banana Fosters French Toast being 'waaaaay too sweet' *in their opinion* to be considered breakfast food. However, this is immediately qualified as a personal opinion and then counteracted by stating it 'was a great finish to my meal.' This is not a complaint about quality or execution, but a subjective preference, and it doesn't detract from the overall positive experience.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly enthusiastic and effusive. Phrases like 'beautiful brunch oasis,' 'felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea,' 'really dug the atmosphere,' 'delicious,' 'yummy,' 'bursting with veggies,' 'perfectly cooked and seasoned,' and 'great finish' all indicate a very strong positive experience. Even the 'negative' about sweetness uses 'waaaaay' for intensity, but it's for a preference.
5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer would absolutely recommend this place. Every aspect mentioned, from the ambiance to multiple food items, is praised without any significant fault. The tone is one of complete satisfaction and enjoyment.
6. **Assigned Rating:** Based on the overwhelmingly positive sentiment, numerous specific praises, the lack of any significant complaints, the intense positive language, and the clear recommendation, this review unequivocally warrants a 5-star rating. The minor comment about the French Toast's sweetness is a personal note and not a genuine criticism of the restaurant's offering or quality.","```json

"Went on Halloween night for dinner.  Very good.  The steak came out sizzling in butter, the way God intended good steak to be.  Service was great but they put a bottle of San Pelligrino and poured it before asking us, now I would normally buy it because I like it and for $8 it is a nice add on, but they should ask first.  Also, beware: the Wedge Salad is just iceburg lettuce and Blue Cheese dressing, NO BACON!!  WTF?  No Bacon, but I asked for a side and it was all good.  Desert was just OK, and their side dishes were above average.  Great for special occasion.  Will go back.  Oh they don't have jack on tap if you want a good draft.  I was really let down with their poor beer selection.",4,4,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive despite specific complaints. The reviewer begins with 'Very good,' praises the steak and service highly, notes 'above average' sides, deems it 'Great for special occasion,' and explicitly states 'Will go back.'
2.  **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Overall 'Very good' initial impression.
    *   Steak was exceptional ('sizzling in butter, the way God intended good steak to be').
    *   Service was 'great'.
    *   Side dishes were 'above average'.
    *   'Great for special occasion'.
    *   Explicitly states 'Will go back'.
3.  **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   San Pellegrino poured without asking (minor, but noted).
    *   Wedge Salad lacked bacon ('NO BACON!! WTF?'), though this was resolved by asking for a side.
    *   Dessert was 'just OK' (mildly negative).
    *   'Poor beer selection' and no 'jack on tap' ('really let down').
4.  **Intensity of Language Used:**
    *   **High Positive:** 'the way God intended good steak to be', 'Service was great', 'Great for special occasion', 'Will go back'.
    *   **High Negative:** 'NO BACON!! WTF?', 'I was really let down with their poor beer selection'. The 'WTF?' is strong, but mitigated by the resolution. The disappointment in beer selection is significant for the reviewer.
5.  **Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states 'Will go back.' and 'Great for special occasion,' indicating a clear recommendation.
6.  **Rating:** While there are strong negative comments regarding the beer selection and the initial salad issue, the core experience (steak, service) was exceptional, and the reviewer plans to return. The 'Will go back' is a very strong indicator of satisfaction that transcends the minor (San Pellegrino, OK dessert) and even the more intense (beer, salad) complaints. The excellent steak and service, coupled with the intent to return, push it beyond a 3-star rating. However, the significant disappointment with the beer selection and the initial 'WTF' over the salad prevent it from being a perfect 5-star review. Therefore, 4 stars is the most appropriate rating, signifying a very good experience with some noticeable drawbacks.","```json

"Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  There's not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  I'll have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses clear appreciation and satisfaction, highlighting the convenience and quality of the specific items they seek.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Well stocked (despite being small)
    *   Has all the Japanese basics
    *   Convenience of a local Japanese grocer (avoids larger, less specialized stores)
    *   Great frozen and dry goods options
    *   Intention to try prepared food (suggests interest and potential positive view)
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Small (immediately mitigated by 'well stocked')
    *   Not a lot of fresh produce (immediately mitigated by 'great frozen and dry goods options')
    *   Prepared food was sold out (a minor personal disappointment, but implies popularity/demand rather than poor service or quality).
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly appreciative and positive ('nice to have,' 'great options'). The 'negatives' are stated factually and mildly, often immediately followed by a positive counterpoint, indicating they are not significant complaints. There is no strong negative emotional language.
5. **Would the reviewer recommend this place:** Absolutely. The phrase 'It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart' is a strong endorsement and implies they would recommend it to anyone looking for this specific type of store.
6. **Star Rating:** Despite mentioning a few minor limitations (small size, less fresh produce, sold out prepared food), the reviewer frames these points very softly and often with an immediate positive counter. The overwhelming sentiment is one of gratitude and strong satisfaction for having a dedicated local Japanese grocer that meets their core needs. The convenience and quality of the basics are highlighted as major wins. The 'sold out' comment, while a missed opportunity for the reviewer, reflects demand and not a flaw in the store's offering. Given the strong appreciation and the minor, non-critical nature of the drawbacks, a 5-star rating is appropriate as the reviewer seems genuinely delighted with the store's existence and offerings.","```json

The overwhelming sentiment is one of gratitude and strong satisfaction for having a dedicated local Japanese grocer that meets their core needs. The convenience and quality of the basics are highlighted as major wins. The 'sold out' comment, while a missed opportunity for the reviewer, reflects demand and not a flaw in the store's offering. Given the strong appreciation and the minor, non-critical nature of the drawbacks, a 5-star rating is appropriate as the reviewer seems genuinely delighted with the store's existence and offerings.""

"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",4,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer explicitly states Vintage 95 is 'damn close' to their 'Platonic Ideal' and concludes with an enthusiastic 'We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.' Even a significant negative event (allergy reaction due to incorrect dessert) was turned into a positive highlight due to exceptional customer service.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Location: 'terrific'
    *   Visual experience: 'very fine' (leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting)
    *   Music volume: Not too loud, allowing conversation (addresses a 'pet peeve' positively)
    *   Atmosphere: 'very close to my Ideal'
    *   Patio: 'EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.' (strongest praise in the review)
    *   Seating: 'fabulous leather club chairs'
    *   Drink selection: Good variety of single malt scotches beyond the usual, reasonably priced
    *   Caroline's martini: 'perfect dirtiness', 'perfect amount of olives and very cold'
    *   Happy Hour menu: 'very interesting choices'
    *   Bruschetta: 'VERY nice and quite unusual,' well-balanced and interesting flavors, good portions
    *   Smoked tomato bisque: 'creamy, smoky,' 'well-balanced flavor,' 'unique,' 'just darn delicious'
    *   Vintage burger: 'VERY tasty,' 'obviously use good beef,' 'HIGHLY recommended'
    *   Fries: 'nicely cooked and nicely seasoned'
    *   Apple pie: 'unusual,' 'tasty,' 'tender but not mushy'
    *   Customer Service (allergy incident): 'EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see,' 'BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.' The perfect handling of the mistake negated its negative impact and highlighted excellent service.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Reviewer's personal philosophical constraint: Vintage 95 is not *quite* their 'Platonic Ideal' (which they reserve 5 stars for), but 'damn close.' This is more a reviewer's personal rating philosophy than a criticism of the establishment.
    *   Caroline's preference for bruschetta bread: 'would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy' (a very minor, subjective preference).
    *   Dessert menu: 'short,' but the reviewer says they are 'okay with that as long as they do it well.' (Not a true complaint).
    *   Allergy incident: Hazelnut gelato served instead of creme fraiche. This was a significant mistake, but the *recovery* was so exceptional that the reviewer explicitly states 'no harm, no foul' and gave 'BIG Kudos' for the service.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is extremely enthusiastic and positive. Words like 'terrific,' 'very fine,' 'fabulous,' 'EXACTLY,' 'VERY nice,' 'darn delicious,' 'VERY tasty,' 'HIGHLY recommended,' 'outstanding customer service,' 'BIG Kudos,' and 'DEFINTELY be back' (all capitalized for emphasis) demonstrate a high level of satisfaction. Even the description of the allergy incident emphasizes the excellent resolution.

5. **Recommendation:** The reviewer clearly and strongly recommends the place: 'We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.'

6. **Assigned Rating:** Despite the reviewer's personal philosophy about a 'Platonic Ideal' for 5 stars, the overwhelming positive feedback, the enthusiastic recommendation, the praise for literally every aspect of their visit (ambiance, food, drinks, and exceptional service recovery from a serious mistake), and the stated intent to return all point to a 5-star experience in practical terms. The handling of the allergy incident, in particular, turned a potential disaster into a testament to their outstanding customer service, effectively solidifying a top rating.","```json

"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.

It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.

We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.

I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.

If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!",4,5,"Step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses pleasure with their experience multiple times and ends with a strong desire to return and even become a regular.

2.  **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:**
    *   Pleased with the experience.
    *   Prompt seating and greeting.
    *   Exceptional service from Al: described as 'quite the character,' made them laugh, attentive, and made good recommendations.
    *   Enjoyed the 'stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere.'
    *   Food highlights: firecracker shrimp, spider roll, shrimp roll, zen salad.
    *   Food described as 'light and tasted fresh.'
    *   Really enjoyed the dipping sauces.
    *   Huge selection of spring rolls, sparking a desire to return for more.
    *   Excellent 'food happy hour' deals ($6 appetizers & $1 off spring rolls).
    *   Excellent 'drinks happy hour' deals ($6 specialty drinks, $5 house wine, $4 well drinks, $2.75 draft beer).
    *   The restaurant appears willing to custom create Vietnamese entrees.
    *   Strong desire to return and be a regular if it were closer to home.
    *   Will keep it 'high on my list of spots to return to.'

3.  **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   'It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside...' (This is a minor point, related to weather, and they successfully sat inside where it was comfortable).
    *   'They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees...' (This is immediately mitigated by the reviewer noting 'it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request').
    *   'If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home...' (This is a personal wish, not a complaint about the restaurant's quality or service).

4.  **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is consistently strong and positive. Phrases like 'pleased with our experience,' 'quite the character,' 'made us laugh quite a bit,' 'enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere,' 'Everything was light and tasted fresh,' 'really enjoyed the dipping sauces,' 'huge selection,' 'can't wait to return,' 'Such a deal!', 'I highly recommend,' 'I could see myself being a regular,' and 'high on my list of spots to return to' all indicate intense satisfaction and enthusiasm.

5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly states 'I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour""' and implicitly recommends the place through their overall glowing review, desire to return, and wish to be a regular.

6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Considering the overwhelmingly positive sentiment, the numerous specific praises for food, service, atmosphere, and value, the strong and enthusiastic language, and the almost non-existent actual complaints (the minor points are either external factors or immediately mitigated), this review clearly indicates a 5-star experience.","```json

"Went for dinner before a Suns game on a Tuesday, got there at 5 and got right in, but the place filled up fast after us.  The atmosphere is awesome, a little brick house split into small rooms with a huge patio dining area.  The service was quality over all.  Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections.",4,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is highly positive, despite a couple of minor critiques. The reviewer uses strong positive language and explicitly recommends the place.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Got in right away (no wait).
    *   Atmosphere is ""awesome.""
    *   Service was ""quality over all.""

    *   Service ""forgot about us throughout the meal"" (between initial attentiveness and check time).
    *   Pizzas were ""not what i expected when i hear thin crust.""
    *   Crust was ""a little fluffy and chewy for my taste"" (a personal preference, not a quality flaw).
    *   Compares pizza unfavorably to Bianco (but still praises Cibo's overall quality).

    *   **Positive:** Uses strong descriptors like ""awesome"" (twice), ""quality"" (multiple times), ""melt in your mouth,"" ""pork butter,"" ""lovely,"" ""definately recommend,"" and the commitment to ""plan on going back."" This indicates a very positive experience.
    *   **Negative:** The negative language is mild. ""Forgot about us"" is the strongest critique, but it's mitigated by the overall 'quality' assessment.

"Every now and then my Vietnamese side craves for PHO...are you surprised!?  Noodle Ranch is my local Pho joint.  I can literally walk to this place :)  Okay, the Pho Tai is great here....I got the combination once and it wasn't as good.  I love the decor here lots and lots of old photos of Vietnam.  Service is always good here and I've been here when their busy and when it's slow.

The reviewer expresses strong enthusiasm for pho, praises specific aspects of the restaurant, and explicitly recommends it.
2. **Specific positive aspects:**
    *   Conveniently located ('local Pho joint', 'can literally walk to this place').
    *   Pho Tai is 'great'.
    *   'Love' the decor, specifically the old photos of Vietnam.
    *   Service is 'always good', even when busy or slow.
    *   Explicitly states: 'I would definitely recommend this place!'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There is only one very mild negative point: the 'combination' pho 'wasn't as good' as the Pho Tai. This is a comparative preference, not a complaint about poor quality, and it doesn't detract significantly from the overall positive experience.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly positive and enthusiastic: 'great' (Pho Tai), 'love' (decor), 'always good' (service), 'definitely recommend'. The use of a smiley face also indicates strong positive feeling. The mild negative ('wasn't as good') is very low intensity.
5. **Recommendation:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly states, 'If you need a Pho fix I would definitely recommend this place!'
6. **Predicted rating:** Based on the overwhelming positive sentiment, multiple strong positive points (food, service, decor, convenience), only a very minor comparative negative, and a strong, explicit recommendation, this review clearly warrants a **5-star** rating.","```json

The reviewer expresses strong enthusiasm for pho, praises specific aspects of the restaurant, and explicitly recommends it.\n2. **Specific positive aspects:**\n    *   Conveniently located ('local Pho joint', 'can literally walk to this place').\n    *   Pho Tai is 'great'.\n    *   'Love' the decor, specifically the old photos of Vietnam.\n    *   Service is 'always good', even when busy or slow.\n    *   Explicitly states: 'I would definitely recommend this place!'\n3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There is only one very mild negative point: the 'combination' pho 'wasn't as good' as the Pho Tai.

The use of a smiley face also indicates strong positive feeling.

Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.,5,1,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer could not even access the business, which is a fundamental failure.
2. **Specific positive aspects:** There are absolutely no positive aspects mentioned. The reviewer's entire experience was one of frustration and failed attempts.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The primary complaints are: (a) The business was closed during its supposed open hours on the reviewer's first visit. (b) Multiple attempts to call during normal business hours went unanswered. (c) The reviewer speculates the business may be permanently closed due to these issues.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is factual but conveys high frustration. Phrases like 'closed during hours they were supposed to be open' and 'did not get anyone to pickup' after 'a few times' demonstrate significant wasted effort and disappointment. The concluding 'They may be closed for good. Not sure.' indicates a complete failure to engage and a very poor perception of the business's viability.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely not. The reviewer couldn't even manage to *try* the service, let alone have a positive experience to recommend.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating:** Given the complete lack of accessibility, wasted time and effort, and the inability to even make contact with the business, this review warrants the lowest possible rating. A business that cannot be reached or visited during stated hours effectively doesn't exist to the customer, leading to a 1-star rating.","```json

"I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream. 

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.",5,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer initially sets up a scenario of personal struggle (shopping while hungry, being indecisive), this is quickly reframed as a consequence of Whole Foods' abundance and quality, not its shortcomings. Phrases like 'foodie's dream,' 'glorious, wholesome products,' and 'Bliss' demonstrate strong positive feelings.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   Described as a 'foodie's dream.'
    *   Aisles are full of 'glorious, wholesome products.'
    *   'Meticulously organized.'
    *   Vast variety ('at least ten varieties of every type of item').
    *   Exciting freshly prepared food section with numerous appealing options (wraps, tapas, wine, sushi, pizza, salad bar, soup, smokehouse, cupcakes).
    *   Live music is 'alluring.'
    *   Specific food items (spicy tuna roll, Pacific salad roll) were 'fresh' and 'crisp.'
    *   The natural pickled ginger was 'Bliss.'
    *   Overall, the meal was 'very satisfying.'
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Described as an 'indecisive individual's nightmare' – however, this is attributed to the overwhelming *abundance* of good choices, not a lack of quality. The reviewer immediately counters this by calling it a 'foodie's dream.'
    *   Took 'fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea' – again, a result of too many options, not a problem with the store.
    *   'Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store' – this is acknowledged but immediately mitigated with 'Then again, it is Whole Foods,' implying it's expected and accepted for the value.
    *   A warning that without a 'game plan,' one might spend 'two hours and twice as much money' – this is presented as helpful advice due to the store's temptations, not a complaint about the store's offerings.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly enthusiastic and descriptive. Words like 'glorious,' 'meticulously,' 'vulture circling its prey,' 'alluring,' 'fresh,' 'crisp,' and 'Bliss' convey strong positive emotions and experiences. Even the 'nightmare' description is used playfully to describe personal indecision in the face of too much goodness.
5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer clearly recommends the place. The 'word of advise' at the end is a guide on *how to best enjoy* the store (by planning) rather than an avoidance warning. The entire review serves as an endorsement for food lovers.
6. **Predicted Star Rating:** 5 stars. The review is overwhelmingly positive, with any potential 'negatives' being reframed as personal challenges due to the store's strengths (abundance, quality, variety) or as expected characteristics of the Whole Foods brand. The reviewer expresses extreme satisfaction and enthusiasm.","```json

Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though,5,4,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is predominantly positive. The reviewer starts with a strong positive statement ('Love chickafila :)') and then adds a minor caveat.
2. **Specific positive aspects:** The reviewer explicitly states 'Love chickafila' and reinforces this with a smiley face, indicating strong affection and satisfaction with the restaurant.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only negative aspect mentioned is that they are 'pretty pricey for fast food'. This suggests a perception of value being slightly off for the category, but it's not described with strong negative language.
4. **Intensity of language:** 'Love' is a very strong positive word, and the ':)' adds to this intensity. 'Pretty pricey' is moderate; it's a mild criticism rather than a vehement complaint. The use of 'though' suggests it's an observation or minor point of contention, not a deal-breaker.
5. **Would recommend?** Given the strong opening 'Love chickafila :)', the reviewer would almost certainly recommend the place. The pricing concern is a secondary thought that doesn't override the primary positive sentiment.
6. **Star rating:** The overwhelming positive sentiment ('Love') strongly points towards a high rating. The single, mild negative point ('pretty pricey') prevents a perfect 5-star rating but is not significant enough to drop it to 3 stars or lower.

"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.

The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.

The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.

"Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. 

I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!

"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...

"I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch.

"So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig. 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.",5,5,"Here's a step-by-step analysis:

3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There are absolutely no negative aspects or complaints from the reviewer's personal experience.

"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, starting with an exclamation of regret for not trying it sooner (""Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!"") and ending with profuse thanks and a declaration of an outstanding and memorable experience. There are no negative criticisms whatsoever.

1.  **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The phrase 'The best fish tacos, period!' is an absolute superlative and leaves no room for doubt about the reviewer's satisfaction with the food.
2.  **Specific positive aspects:** The reviewer explicitly states the 'fish tacos' are 'the best.' The addition of 'period!' amplifies this positive statement. The subsequent comment 'And I hate chain restaurants!' while a general negative, acts as an indirect positive for *this specific restaurant*, implying it offers an authentic or superior experience compared to generic chains, which the reviewer clearly values.
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There are absolutely no negative aspects or complaints mentioned about the restaurant itself. The only negative comment is about 'chain restaurants' in general, which serves to highlight the positive qualities of the reviewed establishment by contrast.
4.  **Intensity of language:** The language is very intense and definitive. 'The best,' 'period!,' and 'I hate' (referring to chains) all convey strong emotions. The strength of the positive language is particularly high.
5.  **Recommendation:** The reviewer would undoubtedly recommend this place. Declaring something 'the best' is the highest form of recommendation.

"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice!

"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?",5,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly and explicitly positive, even enthusiastic and hyperbolic.
2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:**
    *   Initially positive about opening hours (even with minor confusion).
    *   Met by a 'Thai beauty' Lisa.
    *   'Smells are incredible.'
    *   Staff instructed reviewer to 'take my time' when ordering.
    *   Kind inquiry about preferred heat level for each item.
    *   **Mixed Vegetable Soup:** Described as 'Stellar,' 'Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.'
    *   **Papaya Salad (Som-Tum):** 'Phenomenal,' 'most awesome experience of the evening,' praised for the 'Masai-esqe cage of cabbage' for shrimp (attention to detail), 'Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.'
    *   **Peanut Curry:** 'Umami,' converted the reviewer from disliking coconut, 'lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry,' 'Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly,' 'Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.'
    *   **Coconut Ice Cream:** 'Yum,' 'delicious,' 'honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.'
    *   Reviewer felt 'reeling' but wanted to continue the experience.
    *   Called the ice cream a 'Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.'
    *   Explicitly states 'I will be back' and 'I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.'
    *   Praises 'Family-run places are truly number 1.'
    *   Concludes with 'Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV. Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?' indicating a strong, conditioned positive response.
3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:** There are no actual complaints about the restaurant or its offerings. Minor points mentioned are about the reviewer's own actions (poor parking, internal feelings about being watched, personal texture issue with coconut pulp), or minor initial confusions that were resolved positively.
4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly intense and positive, using words like 'Satori to Kaigen!', 'Stellar', 'Phenomenal', 'most awesome experience', 'Beautiful', 'Umami', 'masterful crescendo', 'culinary symphony', 'PAVLOV', and explicit statements of intent to return.
5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer explicitly states 'I will be back' and demonstrates enthusiasm through the 'PAVLOV' analogy, indicating a very strong recommendation.

"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)

Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!

For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!

Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.

Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.",5,5,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, almost effusive. The reviewer uses highly enthusiastic language throughout the entire review.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Returned twice in one week, indicating high satisfaction.
    *   Acknowledges price but immediately defends it as good value for organic, vegetarian, made-to-order food (""You get what you pay for."").
    *   'Happily surprised' after reading other reviews.
    *   Food was 'amazing,' 'portions are huge,' and they had leftovers both times.
    *   Refutes other reviews about cash-only payments, stating they had no trouble with a debit card.
    *   Greeted kindly and given a complimentary plate of fruit.
    *   Mint tea was 'delish!'
    *   Sabzi appetizer: herbs were 'FRESH,' nan 'delicious,' and the smell was 'enough to get us drooling!'
    *   Waiter's flexibility for dietary needs (garlic-free for pregnancy) and the revelation that 'every dish is made when you order it' was a significant positive surprise.
    *   Stews arrived 'steaming hot and smelling delicious.'
    *   Stews were 'HEAVENLY! So many flavors and so fresh!!'
    *   Second visit entrees were 'amazing,' with a special described as 'blissful to smell and eat.'
    *   Overall attributes: 'Everything will be fresh,' 'everything will smell and taste delicious,' and the 'atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.'
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   The only remotely less-than-glowing comment was that the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear were 'ok,' but immediately followed by a preference for the Sabzi, rather than an actual complaint. This is a very mild preference, not a negative experience.
    *   The 'pricey' aspect is not a complaint from the reviewer's perspective, but rather an observation that is then justified as good value.
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and positive, using superlatives and enthusiastic expressions: 'happily surprised,' 'amazing' (multiple times), 'huge,' 'delish!,' 'FRESH' (capitalized), 'delicious,' 'drooling!,' 'what??' (in a positive, surprised way), 'HEAVENLY!' (capitalized), 'blissful,' 'perfect.' The capitalization and exclamation marks further emphasize strong positive feelings.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely. The review concludes with an explicit recommendation: 'Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.' Their repeated visits also serve as a strong implicit recommendation.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming number of highly positive comments, the intense and enthusiastic language, the lack of any significant complaints, and the explicit recommendation, this review clearly warrants a 5-star rating. The reviewer expresses extreme satisfaction and delight.","```json

The capitalization and exclamation marks further emphasize strong positive feelings.\n5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Absolutely. The review concludes with an explicit recommendation: 'Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.' Their repeated visits also serve as a strong implicit recommendation.\n6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming number of highly positive comments, the intense and enthusiastic language, the lack of any significant complaints, and the explicit recommendation, this review clearly warrants a 5-star rating.

"TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it. 
Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl! 
TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is very positive. While the reviewer notes it's the 'ONLY bar at the airport' which might seem like a slight drawback, they immediately follow it with 'so live it-love it,' indicating an acceptance and even encouragement rather than a complaint.

The positive comments about the food and convenience, combined with the encouragement to 'live it-love it,' indicate a strong recommendation.

The initial 'only bar' comment acts as context rather than a detraction from the establishment's quality. Therefore, a 5-star rating is appropriate.","```json

"It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly very positive.

"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The opening line, 'Really? Because it doesn't get any better than this,' sets a very high bar of praise, which is consistently reinforced throughout the review.

The Pros list includes 'Good food,' 'Originality,' 'Portions,' 'Customer service,' and 'Coat hooks at the bar.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only negative aspect explicitly listed is 'Small interior' under the 'Cons' section. The description 'A slight step up from a hole in the wall' is framed more as part of its unique charm ('quaint spot') rather than a complaint.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly enthusiastic and strong in its praise: 'doesn't get any better than this,' 'truly unique,' 'very good flavoring and filling,' 'highly recommend.' The initial 'Really?' acts as an emphatic rhetorical question, underscoring the sincerity of the subsequent praise.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly states, 'I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto' and 'highly recommend to try' the sauces. The overwhelming positive points and lack of significant complaints strongly indicate a recommendation.

"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd.

"I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.  I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.  I had never done any type of ""personal training"" so I was a little apprehensive....and...

I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!  

Case in point:
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, ""Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?""  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like ""this is cake""...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it. 

My Checklist:  
Sense of accomplishment (check)
Strength building (check)
Piece of mind, knowing I am taking care of myself (check)
Good teaching and patience (check)

In short, I love my time at Second Chance.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly and explicitly very positive.

    *   Sense of accomplishment.
    *   Strength building.
    *   Peace of mind.
    *   Good teaching and patience.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There are absolutely no negative aspects or complaints mentioned about Second Chance FitCenter or the trainer, Heat. The reviewer mentions initial apprehension about personal training and a personal doubt about improvement, but both were internal feelings that were positively addressed and overcome by the experience and the trainer's methods.

I blew through that sucker,' 'this is cake,' 'awesome,' 'I loved it,' and the repeated 'check' marks for their checklist, all indicate profound satisfaction and enthusiasm.

"Great facial great customer service

One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.

I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using. 

Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.

Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!",5,5,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1.  **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly very positive. Despite an initial disappointment regarding a cancelled appointment, the reviewer explicitly states they were 'thankful too' and the inconvenience was completely rectified and even turned into a bonus (free upgrade). Every other aspect mentioned is highly positive.
2.  **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Great facial and customer service.
    *   Spa is small, cozy, super cute, and inviting.
    *   Loved the decor (white, clean, girly, classic).
    *   Received a free upgrade to an anti-aging facial due to the rescheduled appointment.
    *   Eyebrow waxing is included with every facial (reviewer called this 'awesome!').
    *   The facial was 'AMAZING' (capitalized for emphasis).
    *   Amanda is very knowledgeable about her work and products.
    *   Amanda kindly obliged a specific request about hair and delivered perfectly.
    *   Reviewer explicitly states they 'will definitely be back!'
3.  **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only negative aspect was the initial appointment cancellation, which caused disappointment 'at first.' However, this was immediately mitigated by the reviewer being 'thankful too' (it was for a contagious illness) and then completely overshadowed by the free upgrade, excellent service recovery, and the overall positive experience. This isn't a complaint that detracts from the overall rating, but rather highlights good customer service recovery.
4.  **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly positive and enthusiastic, using words like 'Great,' 'super cute,' 'inviting,' 'love,' 'awesome,' 'AMAZING,' 'very knowledgeable,' and 'definitely be back!' The only negative phrase ('disappointed at first') is mild and quickly offset.
5.  **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Yes, unequivocally. The reviewer states, 'Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!' This is a strong recommendation and intent for repeat business.
6.  **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the overwhelming positivity, the excellent service recovery for the minor initial inconvenience, the strong language used, and the explicit intent to return, a 5-star rating is clearly warranted.","```json

"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.",5,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive.

"I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer clearly states it has 'become a go-to pizza option' and enthusiastically recommends it at the end.
2. **Specific positive aspects:**

    *   **Service:** Handwritten thank you note, thoughtful follow-up with coupons, 'great service,' free and on-time delivery, incredibly fast delivery (23 mins vs 45 min quote).
    *   **Food:** Pizza is 'particularly good.' Cookies are 'awesome.' Cheesy bread is 'cheesy enough.' Sauce is 'really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.' Salad is 'pretty average but good enough.'
    *   **Delivery:** Free and on time, very fast.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only even slightly lukewarm comment is 'Salad is pretty average,' but this is immediately qualified with 'but good enough for me with a pizza,' effectively neutralizing it as a complaint. There are no actual negative aspects or complaints.

"Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care. Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...

The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like ""OMG"". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And they're probably right. They usually are.

Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's). Service was super friendly and extremely efficient. Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta splurge.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly and explicitly positive. The reviewer starts by celebrating the 'awesomeness' of the place and maintains this celebratory tone throughout.

Finally, despite being 'a little pricy,' the reviewer emphatically states it's 'totally worth it.'
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** The only potential 'negative' mentioned is that it 'can be a little pricy,' but this is immediately and strongly mitigated by the declaration that it's 'totally worth it.' The observation about booth size for groups is factual and not a complaint, as the reviewer notes an alternative for larger parties (at a sister restaurant). There are no actual complaints or dissatisfactions expressed.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language used is highly intense and consistently positive. Examples include 'bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness,' 'awesome New Mexican cuisine,' 'OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control,' 'super friendly and extremely efficient,' and 'totally worth it.'

"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.",5,5,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer expresses extreme satisfaction and loyalty.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:** The chicken salad is described as 'THAT good,' 'perfection,' and 'magically delicious.'

The decor, while described as late 70s (which could be a neutral or negative observation for some), is explicitly praised by the reviewer as 'awesome' and providing 'historic flare,' which they appreciate. They even rationalize the lack of decor updates by stating the money is clearly going into the food.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:** There are no negative aspects or complaints whatsoever. The only potential 'negative' (outdated decor) is spun into a strong positive by the reviewer.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is highly intense and laudatory. Phrases like 'THAT good,' 'perfection,' 'awesome,' and 'magically delicious' convey strong positive emotions. The mention of 20 years of patronage further underscores their satisfaction and loyalty.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** The reviewer would absolutely recommend this place. The entire review is a testament to their love for the chicken salad and the establishment, clearly encouraging others to experience it.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** Given the exclusively positive remarks, the absence of any complaints, the strong endorsements of both the food and the ambiance (as perceived by the reviewer), and the explicit high praise, this review warrants a 5-star rating.","```json

"They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai. 

If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!

"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:

You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.

You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.

You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.

The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.

If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!",2,5,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is complex and ironic. While the reviewer uses overwhelmingly negative language to describe the bar's physical attributes, neighborhood, and the events that transpire (e.g., 'crappiest place known to man,' 'shitty neighborhood where you might die,' 'low lifes,' 'cash only'), the *overall tone* and the reviewer's *repeated patronage* indicate a strong, albeit unconventional, positive sentiment. The reviewer finds a unique, exhilarating value in the chaos and 'eventful things' that happen.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects Mentioned:** The primary positive aspect is that 'eventful things happen here.' The reviewer implies that the unpredictability, wildness, and general 'crapiness' are precisely what make it a desirable destination for a specific type of night. The concluding sentence, 'If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!', serves as a strong, albeit conditional, endorsement.

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    * Friends dancing with a bum.
    * Drinking 'far too many pitchers of PBR' (implying cheap quality/ease of overconsumption).
    * Cash-only policy (leading to a 'fit').
    * Described as 'the crappiest place known to man.'
    * Located in a 'shitty neighborhood where you might die.'
    * No credit cards accepted.
    * Only 'bags of chips for food.'
    * 'Bar full of low lifes.'
    * Getting sick from excessive drinking.
    * Getting lost and disoriented after leaving.
    * Encounters with bums asking for money.
    * Paying for a ride with cigarettes.
    * Waking up with no cash and no memory of friends.

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly intense, hyperbolic, and vivid. Phrases like 'crappiest place known to man' and 'shitty neighborhood where you might die' are extreme. However, this intensity is delivered with a sense of ironic affection and amusement, rather than genuine anger or disappointment. The detailed narrative of a wild night enhances this intensity.

5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer offers a strong, specific recommendation: 'Don't go if you want to have a quiet night... Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes...' The final sentence 'If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!' is a definitive recommendation for its niche. The reviewer clearly enjoys and advocates for the bar *for what it is*, despite (or perhaps because of) its numerous objective flaws.

6. **Star Rating Justification:** Despite the laundry list of objectively negative attributes, the reviewer's tone, repeated patronage, and enthusiastic conditional recommendation point to a very high star rating. This is a classic 'dive bar' review where the 'bad' qualities are precisely what make it authentic, exciting, and appealing to a certain clientele. The reviewer isn't complaining; they are celebrating the chaotic, unique experience the Bikini Lounge consistently delivers. The 'crappiness' is its charm, and for the reviewer, it perfectly fulfills that role. Therefore, a 5-star rating is appropriate as it signifies that the place excels at being exactly what the reviewer wants it to be, even if that means being a 'crappy' place.","```json

The concluding sentence, 'If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!', serves as a strong, albeit conditional, endorsement.\n\n3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**\n    * Friends dancing with a bum.\n    * Drinking 'far too many pitchers of PBR' (implying cheap quality/ease of overconsumption).\n    * Cash-only policy (leading to a 'fit').\n    * Described as 'the crappiest place known to man.'\n    * Located in a 'shitty neighborhood where you might die.'\n    * No credit cards accepted.\n    * Only 'bags of chips for food.'\n    * 'Bar full of low lifes.'\n    * Getting sick from excessive drinking.\n    * Getting lost and disoriented after leaving.\n    * Encounters with bums asking for money.\n    * Paying for a ride with cigarettes.\n    * Waking up with no cash and no memory of friends.\n\n4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language is highly intense, hyperbolic, and vivid. Phrases like 'crappiest place known to man' and 'shitty neighborhood where you might die' are extreme. However, this intensity is delivered with a sense of ironic affection and amusement, rather than genuine anger or disappointment. The detailed narrative of a wild night enhances this intensity.\n\n5. **Reviewer Recommendation:** The reviewer offers a strong, specific recommendation: 'Don't go if you want to have a quiet night... Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes...' The final sentence 'If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!' is a definitive recommendation for its niche. The reviewer clearly enjoys and advocates for the bar *for what it is*, despite (or perhaps because of) its numerous objective flaws.\n\n6. **Star Rating Justification:** Despite the laundry list of objectively negative attributes, the reviewer's tone, repeated patronage, and enthusiastic conditional recommendation point to a very high star rating. This is a classic 'dive bar' review where the 'bad' qualities are precisely what make it authentic, exciting, and appealing to a certain clientele. The reviewer isn't complaining; they are celebrating the chaotic, unique experience the Bikini Lounge consistently delivers. The 'crappiness' is its charm, and for the reviewer, it perfectly fulfills that role. Therefore, a 5-star rating is appropriate as it signifies that the place excels at being exactly what the reviewer wants it to be, even if that means being a 'crappy' place.""

"First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either. 

Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full. 

Drink's are cheap, tacos are good, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think. Go! Have fun, get drunk.... but don't expect anything classy.",3,4,"1. **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. While the reviewer lists a few personal drawbacks (feeling old, 'interesting' people, spending money), these are immediately overshadowed by strong positive statements like 'all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs.' and a direct call to action 'Go! Have fun, get drunk....'. The opening 'at least three stars just because it's Dos' sets a positive baseline that is then built upon.

2. **Specific Positive Aspects:**
    *   It's 'Dos' (implies loyalty/fondness)
    *   'you always have a great time'
    *   'Nothin' but laughs'
    *   'The giant jenga didn't suck either' (meaning it was good)
    *   'staple among the youngins' (popular)
    *   Good for people watching ('get an eye full')
    *   'Drink's are cheap'
    *   'tacos are good'
    *   'bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think' (a relative positive for this type of establishment)
    *   Direct recommendation: 'Go! Have fun, get drunk....'

3. **Specific Negative Aspects or Complaints:**
    *   Made the reviewer 'feel old'
    *   'some interesting people there and not in a good way'
    *   Spent 'more money than I wanted to' (though later states drinks are cheap, so this might be overall spend or personal budget)
    *   'don't expect anything classy' (a disclaimer, not a direct complaint but sets realistic expectations).

4. **Intensity of Language Used:** The language around the positive aspects is enthusiastic and emphatic ('always have a great time', 'Nothin' but laughs', 'totally fit in', 'And boy do you get an eye full', 'Go! Have fun, get drunk....'). The negative points are stated more matter-of-factly and are immediately mitigated or reframed by the overall positive experience. The initial 'at least three stars' is a strong indicator of an inherent positive bias.

5. **Recommendation:** Yes, the reviewer explicitly recommends the place with 'Go! Have fun, get drunk....'.

6. **Assigned Rating:** Combining all factors, the review leans heavily towards a 4-star rating. The reviewer starts with a baseline of 'at least three stars' and then provides numerous reasons why it's a great time, even if it has a few quirks or isn't 'classy.' The positive experiences (fun, laughs, cheap drinks, good tacos, people watching) significantly outweigh the minor personal gripes. It's clearly a place the reviewer enjoys and recommends for what it is, but the minor negatives and the 'don't expect anything classy' suggest it's not a perfect 5-star experience.","```json

"Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.

Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as ""hard rock"" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well. 

Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.",2,2,"1. **Overall sentiment:** The overall sentiment is clearly negative. While there are a few positive operational points, the reviewer expresses significant disappointment regarding the atmosphere, value, and core identity of the establishment, culminating in a strong idiom of dissatisfaction.
2. **Specific positive aspects mentioned:**
    *   Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice (relates to a specific performer, not the general venue experience).
    *   Servers were attentive.
    *   Drinks were frequently refilled.
3. **Specific negative aspects or complaints:**
    *   Jungle-like humidity inside the place.
    *   Not 'hard rock' enough, too family-friendly.
    *   Very small space.
    *   Sparsely populated on a Saturday night in summer (suggests lack of atmosphere).
    *   Overpriced drinks.
    *   Signed guitars on the walls 'do not bang my shutters' (implies the decor/theme is unimpressive or not worth the cost).
    *   The visit was 'only memorable for' the performer and the humidity, implying the rest was forgettable or bad.
4. **Intensity of language used:** The language is quite strong in its negativity. Phrases like 'jungle like humidity,' 'not as hard rock,' 'sparsely populated' (for a Saturday night), 'overpriced drinks,' and especially the concluding 'do not bang my shutters' (an idiom meaning 'does not impress me' or 'does not excite me') convey a significant level of dissatisfaction and a sense of being underwhelmed.
5. **Determine if the reviewer would recommend this place:** Given the pervasive complaints about the atmosphere, value, and overall experience, despite good service, the reviewer would almost certainly *not* recommend this place, especially to someone looking for a 'hard rock' experience or good value.
6. **Based on all factors, assign a rating from 1-5 stars:** The positive aspects (attentive service, one performer) are heavily outweighed by a long list of significant negatives: uncomfortable humidity, lack of desired atmosphere/identity, small space, lack of patrons, and overpriced drinks that don't justify the unimpressive decor. The concluding phrase 'do not bang my shutters' seals the deal on a strongly negative overall impression. While not a complete disaster (thanks to the service), it falls far short of acceptable, warranting a 2-star rating ('I didn't like it').","```json
