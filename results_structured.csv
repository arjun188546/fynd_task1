"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. 

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. 


We were seated immediately. 

Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). 

Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. 

When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. 

Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?",1,1,"This Yelp review presents an overwhelmingly negative experience, despite initial high anticipation. The reviewer's sentiment quickly shifts from hopeful expectation to profound disappointment, frustration, disgust, and ultimately, strong warning.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by initial hope followed by immediate disappointment, growing frustration with service and atmosphere, and culminating in disgust over food quality and extreme dissatisfaction with value. Phrases like 'thought twice immediately,' 'insanely snobby,' 'ridiculous,' 'too tired,' 'didn't go down too easily,' and 'recommending that you not go there' underscore this.

**2. Language Intensity:** The review uses numerous strong and extreme negative words and phrases: 'best thing to have happened to me' (initially, creating a stark contrast with the reality), 'iffy,' 'a little off,' 'insanely snobby,' 'disappeared for 10-15 minutes,' 'ridiculous,' '45 minutes, easily,' 'good 5 minutes' (for sitting in the dark), 'boring beige walls,' 'too tired,' 'finally arrived,' 'taken aback,' 'didn't go down too easily,' 'dropped 90 dollars,' 'as much as we could stand,' and the explicit 'recommending that you not go there, why bother?'. These indicate a highly unsatisfactory and memorable negative experience.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete, detailed negative feedback across all key areas:
    *   **Atmosphere:** 'Iffy' parking, the place 'didn't seem to stand up to the signage,' unmemorable/disliked art, 'boring beige walls,' and a significant incident of the table lamp going out, leaving them in the dark for 'a good 5 minutes.'
    *   **Service:** The waiter was 'a little off,' 'insanely snobby,' frequently 'disappeared for 10-15 minutes,' failed to refill soft drinks without being flagged, and staff were slow to notice the lamp outage. Food took '45 minutes, easily' to arrive.
    *   **Food Quality:** The specific 'mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce' was described as an unappetizing combination that 'didn't go down too easily,' implying it was unpleasant or nearly inedible.
    *   **Value:** 'Dropped 90 dollars on the meal' for an experience where they were 'too tired' to eat the food in the restaurant and felt 'compelled to finish as much as we could stand,' indicating extremely poor value for money.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am recommending that you not go there,' making the recommendation likelihood unequivocally negative. This is a clear warning to other potential customers.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The issues are severe and cumulative. Service was abysmal (snobby, absent waiter, extreme wait times, lack of attentiveness). The atmosphere was disappointing and even problematic (dark table). The food itself was described as unpalatable. The high price tag compounded the deep dissatisfaction, leading to the customers being too exhausted to even eat their meal on-site. This combination represents a complete failure across all major aspects of a dining experience.","```json

"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!",1,1,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly negative sentiment, driven by multiple critical failures across service, food quality, and value. The reviewer's initial intention to support the establishment due to 'controversy' makes the subsequent 'subpar' experience even more impactful.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of severe disappointment, frustration, and eventual anger. Words like 'Unfortunately,' 'subpar,' 'HORRENDOUS,' 'dissappeared,' 'overpriced,' 'really bad,' and the concluding 'no intention of ingesting there food ever again!' leave no doubt about the reviewer's negative feelings.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is highly intense. Superlatives and extreme words are prominent: 'subpar to say the least,' 'literally outnumbered,' 'HORRENDOUS' (capitalized for emphasis), 'so overpriced,' 'really bad,' and the hyperbole of 'waisting away there at this moment.' The final statement is a definitive and absolute refusal to return or consume food from the establishment again.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Service:** This is the primary complaint and described as 'HORRENDOUS.' The waitress 'dissappeared' after taking the order, prompting the reviewer to almost get refills themselves. Most critically, the waitress did not return to collect payment, leaving the reviewer stranded and requiring cash to leave, despite the restaurant being nearly empty ('only one other couple inside').
    *   **Food Quality:** The sushi was deemed 'so overpriced for what it was.' While the 'Philadelphia roll was decent,' the 'California roll was really bad.'
    *   **Atmosphere/Crowd:** The review notes the restaurant was virtually empty ('only one other couple inside,' 'outnumbered by the people working there') which makes the poor service even less excusable.
    *   **Value:** Explicitly stated as 'so overpriced for what it was.'

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely low. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!' This is a clear and strong recommendation *against* visiting the restaurant.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The issues are highly severe. The service failure was not just slow but led to a situation where the reviewer could not pay and almost couldn't leave, which is a fundamental operational breakdown. Coupled with overpriced and 'really bad' food, the entire experience was a disaster. The initial intention to support the business was completely negated by the terrible experience, turning a potential advocate into a strong detractor. These are not minor inconveniences but fundamental flaws that significantly impact the customer's ability to complete their transaction and enjoy their meal.","```json

"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! 

The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. 

Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!",1,1,"The review exhibits an extremely negative sentiment, strong language intensity, and severe complaints, leading to a unequivocal recommendation against the store.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis**: The dominant emotional tone is one of intense anger, frustration, and deep disappointment. The reviewer explicitly states, ""leaving this store angry"" and ""stormed out soooo mad,"" bookending the review with expressions of extreme negative emotion.
2.  **Language Intensity**: The language used is highly intense and includes strong negative superlatives and hyperbolic statements such as ""incredibly useless,"" ""wander aimlessly,"" and ""soooo mad."" The repeated declaration of ""I will never go back"" (mentioned twice in different contexts) underscores the finality of their negative experience.
3.  **Specific Feedback**: The review provides concrete details across multiple aspects:
    *   **Service**: Staff are described as ""incredibly useless"" and difficult to locate. Specific instances include an older employee unwilling to check the back for an item and a customer service representative refusing to call another store, instead telling the reviewer to do it themselves.
    *   **Store Layout/Navigation**: The store is criticized for being ""huge with very little signs to guide you,"" leading the reviewer to ""wander aimlessly.""
    *   **Product Availability**: The desired item, needed to finish a project, was out of stock.
    *   **Comparative**: The reviewer actively recommends alternatives, stating ""Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!""
4.  **Recommendation Likelihood**: The reviewer has a 0% likelihood of returning, stating a clear and firm ""I promise to never go back."" They actively steer others away by recommending competitors.
5.  **Complaint Severity**: The complaints are severe and encompass fundamental operational failures: persistent difficulty finding assistance, unhelpful and unresponsive staff, poor store navigability, and lack of essential product stock. The emotional impact of these issues led the reviewer to ""storm out"" in anger.","```json

"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good.",1,1,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses strong frustration and disappointment due to a significant service failure: being informed that they couldn't order dinner after finishing appetizers and just minutes after the kitchen had closed, despite explicitly stating they were there for dinner upon arrival. The language intensity is high, using phrases like 'overpriced entrees,' 'crappy service,' and 'Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance.' The reviewer also emphasizes the negative experience by stating it was the 'fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service,' indicating a pattern of dissatisfaction. Specific feedback includes a severe service lapse (lack of communication about kitchen closing), perceived poor value ('overpriced entrees'), and the ultimate consequence of having to leave and find another restaurant. The recommendation likelihood is extremely low, with a definitive statement of 'we won't be giving them another chance' and a strong warning implicit in the overall tone.

"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",1,1,"This review presents an overwhelmingly negative experience, leading to a strong 1-star rating.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of profound disappointment, frustration, and eventually, anger. The reviewer's initial positive anticipation was completely shattered by a series of negative interactions and product quality issues. Phrases like 'pure distaste,' 'very cold treatment,' 'loudly discussed about our losing our interest,' 'wanted to send it back,' 'stale-looking mousse,' 'not up to par,' 'awful, condescending look,' and 'never going to recommend' clearly convey a deeply negative emotional journey.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is highly intense and critical, employing strong negative descriptors and superlatives. Examples include 'pure distaste,' 'very cold treatment,' 'stale-looking mousse,' 'cracked edges,' 'ice crystals' (interpreted as a sign of old/refrozen), 'definitely not up to par,' 'certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence,' 'awful, condescending look,' and the decisive 'never going to recommend... anymore' and 'won't be returning.' This sustained intensity underscores the severity of the reviewer's dissatisfaction.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Service:** While the initial greeting by a male host was warm and accommodating (allowing them to choose a different table), the server (Butai) received severe criticism. Her 'look of pure distaste' upon learning they only wanted dessert, her abrupt communication ('We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two...'), 'very cold treatment,' and 'awful, condescending look' were major points of contention. The reviewer felt the server 'didn't deserve' a tip. The host's explanation for the mousse's appearance was accepted for trial but didn't fully mollify the reviewer.
    *   **Food Quality:** The primary reason for the visit – a beloved dark chocolate mousse – was described as 'stale-looking,' having 'cracked edges,' and its green tea ice cream had 'ice crystals,' which the reviewer interpreted as a sign of being old or refrozen. The presentation was 'not up to par' with a previous experience, and the texture was 'cold and stiff,' more like ganache than 'silky-smooth chocolate decadence.' This constitutes a significant failure in the core product.
    *   **Atmosphere:** 'Didn't like the energy in that room' is a subjective negative point, though a 'comfortable patio' was noted positively during the wait.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The recommendation likelihood is unequivocally negative. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore,' and 'Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.' They also mention needing to find an alternative place for a visiting friend, directly illustrating their refusal to endorse the restaurant.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are extremely severe. The service issues were not minor oversights but perceived as direct, condescending rudeness from the server, causing significant discomfort and alienating the guests. The food quality issues were also severe, particularly for the specific item the reviewer had come to enjoy, directly questioning its freshness and preparation, falling far short of previous standards. The combination of rude service and a disappointing key menu item creates an experience that is well beyond 'below average.'

**Conclusion:** The review details a cascade of failures, from service demeanor to food quality, that completely ruined the dining experience for the reviewer and their cousin. The strong, negative language and explicit refusal to return or recommend align perfectly with the criteria for a 1-star rating, signifying a 'terrible experience' with 'extremely negative' feedback that 'warns others away'.","```json

This constitutes a significant failure in the core product.\n    *   **Atmosphere:** 'Didn't like the energy in that room' is a subjective negative point, though a 'comfortable patio' was noted positively during the wait.\n\n4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The recommendation likelihood is unequivocally negative. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore,' and 'Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.' They also mention needing to find an alternative place for a visiting friend, directly illustrating their refusal to endorse the restaurant.\n\n5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are extremely severe. The service issues were not minor oversights but perceived as direct, condescending rudeness from the server, causing significant discomfort and alienating the guests. The food quality issues were also severe, particularly for the specific item the reviewer had come to enjoy, directly questioning its freshness and preparation, falling far short of previous standards. The combination of rude service and a disappointing key menu item creates an experience that is well beyond 'below average.'\n\n**Conclusion:** The review details a cascade of failures, from service demeanor to food quality, that completely ruined the dining experience for the reviewer and their cousin. The strong, negative language and explicit refusal to return or recommend align perfectly with the criteria for a 1-star rating, signifying a 'terrible experience' with 'extremely negative' feedback that 'warns others away'.""

"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.

I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!",1,1,"The dominant emotional tone is strongly negative, explicitly stating the reviewer was 'really disappointed.'

"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion.

"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho.",1,1,"The review exhibits a predominantly negative, disappointed, and sarcastic emotional tone. While the reviewer notes they 'did not get ill from the food here' (a low bar, but a point of relief for them given prior experiences in Phoenix) and that 'the fries were good tho', these minor positives are thoroughly overshadowed by severe complaints.

The language intensity is quite high, featuring strong negative descriptors and exclamations such as 'soggy coleslaw', 'flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread', and '$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!)'. The emphatic 'nope' repeated for portion size and the sarcastic closing about a 'realistic scale' Kosher experience in New York further underscore deep dissatisfaction.

Specific feedback highlights several critical issues: 
*   **Value:** Perceived as extremely poor, with a sandwich, fries, and soggy coleslaw costing $12.95, and a total of nearly $30 for two sandwiches and two sodas. This is a major complaint.
*   **Sandwich Quality:** The main dish is described as 'flavorless' and tasting 'like stale bread', a fundamental failure for a deli.
*   **Portion Size:** Expectations of 'HUGE' sandwiches were completely unmet, leading to disappointment.
*   **Coleslaw Quality:** Described as 'soggy'.
*   **Atmosphere:** Not 'seedy enough' for the reviewer's personal preference, though this is subjective.
*   **Food Safety:** The only clear positive is not getting ill, which is framed against a history of getting sick from other Phoenix food.

The recommendation likelihood is extremely low; the reviewer is clearly warning others away, particularly regarding value and the quality of the main food item. The complaint severity is very high, focusing on core aspects of the dining experience: the exorbitant price for what was delivered, the poor quality of the signature sandwich, and unmet expectations regarding portion size. The minor positive points are insufficient to redeem the overall experience, which is portrayed as a significant letdown.","```json

"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.

The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?""
Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   

Sincerely,
Morgan",1,1,"The dominant emotional tone of this review is one of intense anger, frustration, and sarcasm. The reviewer expresses strong indignation at the waitress's perceived rudeness and impatience. Language intensity is very high, marked by the use of expletives ('What the fuck, bitch', 'all fucking night'), strong adverbs ('completely ruined'), and a series of rhetorical questions designed to underscore the waitress's perceived shortcomings and hypocrisy. 

Specific feedback centers almost entirely on a negative service encounter. The waitress is criticized for rushing the customer to order, despite it being 10:30 PM on a busy Saturday night and the kitchen not yet closed. Further complaints detail the waitress taking longer to process the bill than the customer took to eat, and an inability to correctly count change. While the reviewer initially states 'I like Ra for the atmosphere,' this positive aspect is immediately negated by the claim that the waitress 'completely ruined' it. There is a notable absence of specific feedback on the food quality, taste, or presentation, indicating the experience was entirely overshadowed by the service interaction.

Given the overwhelming negativity and the strong, direct complaints, the recommendation likelihood is extremely low. The reviewer's tone is a clear warning to others about potential service issues.

"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.

The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip.",1,1,"This review is overwhelmingly negative and warrants a 1-star rating based on a multitude of severe issues across all evaluation criteria.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of extreme dissatisfaction, disgust (due to hair in food), frustration (ordering process, dismissive staff), and profound disappointment with the food quality. Phrases like 'pretty bad', 'does not taste good', 'down right dismissive', 'boring, no flavor', and 'Not worth the trip' clearly convey a terrible and regrettable experience.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses strong, direct negative language. The emphasis on 'Not just 1 but 2' hairs highlights the severity and unacceptability of the hygiene issue. 'Down right dismissive' is a potent and unambiguous descriptor for poor service. The concluding 'Not worth the trip' acts as a clear and intense warning to potential customers, indicating an extremely poor overall value and experience that should be avoided.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details across multiple critical aspects:
    *   **Food Quality:** Two hairs found in Bhel Puri (a major and critical hygiene issue); Bhel Puri and Papdi Chaat explicitly described as 'boring, no flavor', indicating a fundamental lack of quality; Pani Puri was only 'OK', which is the only neutral-to-mildly-positive comment, but it's heavily overshadowed.
    *   **Service:** The counter staff is described as 'down right dismissive', highlighting poor customer interaction. There was also confusion and lack of proactive communication regarding soda collection, which the customer had to inquire about.
    *   **Atmosphere/Process:** There was 'no indication of how you order your food', leading to initial confusion and frustration.
    *   **Value:** Explicitly states 'Not worth the trip', directly implying very poor value for money and time invested.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Not worth the trip,' which is a direct and strong warning against visiting the establishment. There is absolutely no likelihood of recommendation; rather, it's a clear discouragement.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are extremely severe. Finding two hairs in food is a critical health and hygiene violation, which for most diners is an immediate deal-breaker. This issue, coupled with consistently poor food taste ('boring, no flavor' for multiple items), dismissive service, and a confusing ordering process, represents a fundamentally flawed and unacceptable dining experience. The issues are severe enough to deter any future visits and to strongly warn others away.","```json

"It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.  

To the negative experience.....
My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Can't you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.

I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading....
My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling.",1,1,"The review exhibits an overwhelmingly negative dominant emotional tone, leading to a predicted 1-star rating. While initially mentioning the basic utility of the supermarket and the convenience of an in-store Wells Fargo, these brief neutral/minor positive points are entirely overshadowed by two highly negative experiences. 

The language intensity is exceptionally high, marked by exclamations like ""WTF?!?"", strong accusations such as ""rudely says,"" ""make every race hate you even more,"" ""arrogance,"" ""loud voice,"" ""verbal abuse,"" and the very serious claim of ""Racial profiling."" These terms convey deep frustration, anger, and a perception of severe mistreatment. 

Specific feedback centers on two negative incidents: first, a rude comment from another customer (not an employee) regarding non-English speaking, which the reviewer interprets as a xenophobic attack (""taking SB 1070 in your own hands?""). Second, and more critically, an employee's interaction with a child pointing at a lottery machine, described as rushing over and speaking in a ""loud voice,"" which the reviewer unequivocally labels ""verbal abuse"" and ""Racial profiling."" 

Given the severity of these complaints, particularly the accusations of verbal abuse and racial profiling directly involving an employee, the recommendation likelihood is extremely low. The reviewer's tone suggests they are actively warning others away rather than recommending the establishment.

"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast ""elites"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) 

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixin's""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":(

The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)",1,1,"This Yelp review is an overwhelmingly negative account of the reviewer's experience at Skip & Jan's. The structured framework reveals the following:

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of extreme disgust, disappointment, and revulsion, heavily couched in sarcasm and dark humor. While the opening is playful, the description of the establishment quickly devolves into intense negativity, portraying the restaurant as an unhygienic and unpleasant environment. The final 'positive' statement about shared adversity is a clear sarcastic jab, not genuine praise.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is exceptionally intense and filled with superlatives and extreme descriptors. Words like 'grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest,' 'crappy,' 'faded felt,' 'extreme humanity,' 'disgusting,' 'ground ""creature"",' 'soupy brine,' and 'boiled' (for wings) are used to vividly paint a picture of a terrible experience. The reviewer employs hyperbole ('total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars...$832') and vivid imagery ('relief map of the Hawaiian Islands' for grease) to emphasize the severity of the issues.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides abundant specific details across multiple aspects:
    *   **Atmosphere/Ambiance:** Detailed descriptions of a dilapidated parking lot (low-value cars), 'crappy old wood paneling,' 'circa 1955 high school cafeteria' furniture, an 'intriguing mix' of TVs, 'faded felt' pool tables with serious-looking players, and an overwhelming, multi-layered 'extreme humanity' smell (spilled beer, smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food). The impending karaoke is the final straw.
    *   **Food Quality:** The 'taco meat hot tray' is described as 'disgusting,' 'ground ""creature,""' and an 'ocean of brown/orange grease.' The reviewer struggled to make an edible taco, and a friend's ordered wings were 'boiled' and 'wet' rather than crispy.
    *   **Service/Value:** Service is not explicitly mentioned but implied through the self-serve buffet. Value is implicitly extremely low, as the Lifetime group supposedly picked it as a 'losing' strategy.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would absolutely not recommend this place. Every aspect of the review, despite its humorous framing, serves as a strong warning to potential patrons. The closing remark about the restaurant making their group 'nearly invincible' is a sarcastic condemnation, not an endorsement.

  ""explanation"": ""This Yelp review is an overwhelmingly negative account of the reviewer's experience at Skip & Jan's. The structured framework reveals the following:\n\n1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of extreme disgust, disappointment, and revulsion, heavily couched in sarcasm and dark humor. While the opening is playful, the description of the establishment quickly devolves into intense negativity, portraying the restaurant as an unhygienic and unpleasant environment. The final 'positive' statement about shared adversity is a clear sarcastic jab, not genuine praise.\n\n2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is exceptionally intense and filled with superlatives and extreme descriptors. Words like 'grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest,' 'crappy,' 'faded felt,' 'extreme humanity,' 'disgusting,' 'ground \""creature\"",' 'soupy brine,' and 'boiled' (for wings) are used to vividly paint a picture of a terrible experience. The reviewer employs hyperbole ('total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars...$832') and vivid imagery ('relief map of the Hawaiian Islands' for grease) to emphasize the severity of the issues.\n\n3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides abundant specific details across multiple aspects:\n    *   **Atmosphere/Ambiance:** Detailed descriptions of a dilapidated parking lot (low-value cars), 'crappy old wood paneling,' 'circa 1955 high school cafeteria' furniture, an 'intriguing mix' of TVs, 'faded felt' pool tables with serious-looking players, and an overwhelming, multi-layered 'extreme humanity' smell (spilled beer, smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food). The impending karaoke is the final straw.\n    *   **Food Quality:** The 'taco meat hot tray' is described as 'disgusting,' 'ground \""creature,\""' and an 'ocean of brown/orange grease.' The reviewer struggled to make an edible taco, and a friend's ordered wings were 'boiled' and 'wet' rather than crispy.\n    *   **Service/Value:** Service is not explicitly mentioned but implied through the self-serve buffet. Value is implicitly extremely low, as the Lifetime group supposedly picked it as a 'losing' strategy.\n\n4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would absolutely not recommend this place. Every aspect of the review, despite its humorous framing, serves as a strong warning to potential patrons. The closing remark about the restaurant making their group 'nearly invincible' is a sarcastic condemnation, not an endorsement.\n\n5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are extremely severe, touching upon unsanitary conditions, inedible food, a foul atmosphere, and even potential health issues ('kind of a rough morning, this morning'). The cumulative effect of these complaints paints a picture of a truly terrible dining and social experience.\n\nGiven the overwhelming negativity, the extreme language, the extensive and severe complaints about every observable aspect, and the clear implicit warning to others, this review unequivocally warrants a 1-star rating.""

"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",1,3,"This review presents a deeply mixed experience. The reviewer expresses strong enthusiasm for the atmosphere, 'casual night time festivities,' mechanical bull, unique desserts, and 'badass' drinks, explicitly stating they 'will continue to come for the fun atmosphere.' This commitment to return and the enthusiastic language for specific elements lean towards a positive sentiment.

However, the food receives overwhelmingly negative and intense feedback. Words like 'disgusting,' 'dry and cold,' 'tasteless,' and 'maybe even worse' are used to describe the dishes, with specific complaints about the dip, onion rings, burger, and bacon. The sarcastic comment about cooking 'bacon tasteless' highlights the severity of the disappointment in the food quality.

Therefore, the sentiment analysis reveals a split: highly positive for atmosphere, drinks, and desserts; extremely negative for food. The language intensity is high on both ends of the spectrum. The specific feedback is detailed for both the enjoyable (atmosphere, certain menu items) and unenjoyable (all sampled food items) aspects. The recommendation likelihood is conditional – the reviewer will return for the atmosphere but explicitly 'staying away from the grub.' The complaint severity regarding the food is very high, suggesting fundamental failures in kitchen execution.

Considering the review guidelines, a 3-star rating (Average/mixed experience, balanced positives and negatives, neutral stance) is the most fitting. While there's strong love for the entertainment and drinks, the severe and pervasive issues with the food prevent it from being a 4-star experience, and the clear intention to return for the fun keeps it from dropping to a 2-star rating. It's a classic case of an establishment excelling in one area while failing dramatically in another, resulting in a balanced, albeit polarized, overall assessment.","```json

"I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.",2,2,"This review explicitly rates the experience as 2 stars and the analysis strongly aligns with this. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of frustration, disappointment, and annoyance, tinged with a sense of resignation ('okay i guess', 'whatever i guess'). There's a clear undertone of feeling inconvenienced and poorly treated by management. The only genuinely positive sentiment is for the clean grounds; everything else is negative or a reluctant acceptance of a bad situation.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to high. Phrases like 'kinda disorganized', 'thank god', 'FINALLY moved in', 'big freakin heater tank', 'EVERYTHING breaks', 'my house is falling apart!', and 'really annoying' convey strong negative feelings. The warning 'So be careful' is also a strong dissuasive statement. The use of 'freakin' and 'falling apart' adds to the emotional weight.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides highly specific and critical feedback across multiple areas:
    *   **Staff/Service:** Disorganized, got move-in dates wrong, tried to rush the reviewer out of the office when asking questions.
    *   **Move-in Experience:** Incorrect move-in dates, assigned a different apartment than originally shown.
    *   **Apartment Features/Quality:** Heater tank in the linen closet (space issue), unfair water billing (paying more due to non-division of costs), multiple critical items breaking ('EVERYTHING breaks' - shower broken twice, closet light broke, bathroom light fell, kitchen stove broke, washer broke).
    *   **Maintenance:** Consistently poor, with numerous essential fixtures and appliances failing within a short timeframe.
    *   **Value:** Implied poor value due to hidden costs (water) and constant repairs.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Clean grounds (the only positive).

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer's recommendation likelihood is extremely low, explicitly stating, 'So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.' This is a direct warning to others to avoid the property.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are severe and impact multiple aspects of daily living, safety, and finances. Getting the wrong apartment, facing safety hazards (lights falling off walls), significant financial impact from water billing, and constant breakdowns of essential appliances (shower, stove, washer) are major issues, not minor inconveniences. The issues are systemic, indicating poor management, property quality, and maintenance.","```json

"After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGR's that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.",2,2,"This review exhibits a predominantly negative sentiment, heavily influenced by critical issues despite some positive remarks about the service. 

**Sentiment Analysis:** The overall sentiment is one of disappointment and dissatisfaction. While service is consistently praised as 'very nice and attentive' and 'very patient,' core aspects of the dining experience—the seating arrangement and the main dish—receive strong negative feedback. The reviewer expresses 'hate' and 'sucks' regarding the tables and labels the gyro 'definitely the worst one I've had.'

**Language Intensity:** The language intensity is notably high on the negative side. Superlatives and extreme words like 'I *hate* this,' 'sucks,' and 'definitely the worst one I've had' are used to describe the table situation and the gyro, respectively. This strong negative vocabulary indicates deep dissatisfaction. Positive language for the service ('very nice,' 'attentive,' 'patient') is positive but less intense than the negative descriptors.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Service:** Excellent feedback – described as 'very nice,' 'attentive,' and 'very patient' even with party size fluctuations. This is a clear positive.
*   **Atmosphere/Crowd:** 'wasn't crowded' is mentioned, which implies a lack of vibrancy but is linked to the good service.
*   **Seating Arrangement:** A major negative point. The combination of round and square tables for a large party was 'awkward' and 'hated,' significantly impacting the comfort and flow of the meal.
*   **Food (Appetizers):** Saganaki was 'definitely good' with 'nice and warm' pita. This is a positive.
*   **Food (Main Course - Gyro):** Extremely negative feedback. Described as 'definitely the worst one I've had,' with a lukewarm pita and 'kind of tough' meat. The tzatziki was 'fine' but its side placement was 'a little weird.' This is a critical failure for a Greek restaurant.

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.' This directly aligns with the 2-star guideline of being 'disappointed' and 'unlikely to return.' The significant complaints about the main course and table arrangement strongly suggest the reviewer would not recommend this restaurant to others.

**Complaint Severity:** The complaints are severe. The main course (gyro) being the 'worst one I've had' is a critical issue for a restaurant, especially a 'full Greek restaurant.' The table arrangement, described with strong emotional language ('hate,' 'sucks'), also represents a significant detractor from the dining experience. While service was a positive, it was clearly overshadowed by these major grievances.","```json

"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.",2,2,"This review exhibits a strong sentiment of disappointment and unmet expectations, leading to a below-average rating.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of significant dissatisfaction and disappointment. The reviewer expresses that their high expectations (due to both personal criticality and the restaurant's Biltmore location) were completely unfulfilled. There's a somewhat critical and even dismissive undertone, particularly in the self-proclaimed 'super critical' nature and the remark about 'people of the Midwest.'

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is quite intense in its negativity for the initial items. Phrases like 'not very good at all' for both guacamole and salsa denote strong disapproval. The 'rest of the food was just okay' indicates mediocrity rather than any positive experience. 'Expected so much better' clearly highlights significant disappointment, emphasizing the gap between expectation and reality.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete feedback primarily on food quality. The guacamole and salsa are explicitly described as 'not very good at all,' which are foundational elements for a Mexican restaurant. The 'rest of the food' is categorized as 'just okay,' implying it was mediocre and uninspiring. There is no direct feedback on service, atmosphere, or specific value, although the location 'in the Biltmore' implicitly sets a higher expectation for value/quality.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer is highly unlikely to recommend this restaurant. The entire review is framed as a negative experience where their initial skepticism was confirmed. While they speculate about others' potential ratings, this is not a recommendation from their personal standpoint; rather, it suggests others might have lower standards than theirs.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are moderately to severely critical, especially concerning the core items. The failure of guacamole and salsa ('not very good at all') is a significant issue for a Mexican restaurant, particularly for a 'super critical' diner. The subsequent 'just okay' for other dishes means there were no redeeming culinary highlights. This constitutes a substantial letdown and a disappointing experience, categorizing it as below average.","```json

"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",2,1,"This Yelp review presents an overwhelmingly negative sentiment, utilizing highly intense language to describe a series of severe disappointments. The reviewer had a previous 'not overly impressed' experience and decided to give Nourish another chance, only to encounter a much worse outcome.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of profound disappointment, disgust, and frustration. Phrases like 'bland and lackluster,' 'not worth the price or the wait,' 'very poor planning,' 'incredibly long wait,' 'by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed,' 'downright disgusting,' 'definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted,' 'granular texture equivalent to fine gravel,' 'strange taste,' 'off-putting texture,' and 'tastebuds reeling in horror' clearly convey extreme negativity.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language is exceptionally intense, marked by numerous superlatives and extreme descriptors. Words such as 'incredibly long,' 'by far the most flavorless,' 'absolutely no seasoning... or flavor to it at all,' 'downright disgusting,' 'worst breakfast item ever tasted,' 'fine gravel,' 'choke down,' and 'reeling in horror' highlight a catastrophic failure of the dining experience. The detailed, vivid descriptions of unpleasant textures and tastes underscore the severity of the issues.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides abundant specific feedback across multiple categories:
    *   **Food Quality:** The egg sandwich was 'flavorless,' the sweet potato hash 'mushy, flavorless,' and 'downright disgusting.' The veggie quiche suffered from 'undercooked quinoa mixed throughout' (not a crust), creating a 'granular texture equivalent to fine gravel,' with 'no discernible pieces of the veggies,' and a 'strange taste.' Even the second Bloody Mary was 'flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.'
    *   **Service:** There was an 'incredibly long wait' for both food and drinks, despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full. The restaurant also ran 'out of bread,' which the reviewer attributes to 'very poor planning by management.'
    *   **Atmosphere:** The only positive mentioned is the 'nice patio' with a 'view of the lush foliage,' but this is explicitly stated as 'not enough to bring us back.'
    *   **Value:** Explicitly stated as 'not worth the price or the wait.'

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'these elements are not enough to bring us back' and describes leaving with 'tastebuds reeling in horror,' indicating a definitive and strong non-recommendation. They are actively warning others away by sharing their terrible experience.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The issues are of the highest severity. The food is described as bordering on inedible, with fundamental flaws in taste, texture, and preparation ('worst breakfast item ever tasted,' 'disgusting,' 'granular texture'). Service failures include excessive wait times and poor operational planning (running out of bread). These are not minor complaints but critical failures across the core aspects of a restaurant experience.","```json

"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.",2,1,"The review presents a complex picture, initially detailing numerous positive aspects of Dilly's Deli over several years of patronage. These positives include an excellent location, clean and charming décor, friendly and quick service, plentiful and interesting menu offerings, use of Boar's Head ingredients, delicious bread, and highly-rated cookies and brownies. The language used for these points is often strong, with words like 'excellent,' 'charming,' 'friendly and quick,' 'a plus,' and 'deliciously.'

However, the dominant emotional tone shifts dramatically due to several critical negative experiences. The reviewer explicitly mentions finding a 'dead fly' in a salad and, in a more recent visit, discovering a 'hair' on a pickle spear. These are severe hygiene and food safety complaints that are highlighted as deal-breakers. Beyond these, consistent issues with sandwich assembly (uneven meat distribution) and flavor deficiencies in a tried wrap (lacked flavor and tasted processed) contribute to the negative sentiment. Minor negatives include soups not being 'piping hot' and seating limitations during peak hours, as well as a perception of being 'a bit pricier' than competitors.

The language intensity for the negatives is very strong, especially with the 'dead fly' and 'hair' incidents, which are classified as 'terrible experiences' and 'strong complaints' per the guidelines. The ultimate and most impactful statement is the reviewer's declaration: 'Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.' This definitive statement of non-return directly translates to a zero recommendation likelihood for future patrons.

While the review is balanced with many positives, the critical nature and repeated occurrence of the hygiene complaints (fly and hair) are paramount. These issues are so severe that they completely overshadow all positive aspects for the reviewer, leading to an absolute decision not to patronize the establishment again and implicitly warning others. According to the guidelines, a 'terrible experience' with 'strong complaints' that 'warns others away' warrants a 1-star rating, despite the reviewer's acknowledgment of some good qualities the deli possesses.","```json

"Love the coffee not thrilled about my service. Of the 4-3 times I have been in the barista has never been behind the counter ready to serve me.  Every time that I have walked in they follow me off the patio where they have been smoking.  I know that you are entitled to a break but, sitting out chit chatting with your friends smoking is not what you get paid for.  Either I have bad timing coming in when they are on break or the kids there are huge slackers.",2,2,"This review presents a very mixed, but ultimately negative, experience. While the reviewer expresses strong approval for the product ('Love the coffee'), the consistent and severe complaints about service heavily outweigh this positive.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is frustration and disappointment regarding service, contrasting with enthusiasm for the coffee. Key negative phrases include 'not thrilled about my service,' 'never been behind the counter ready to serve me,' and 'huge slackers.'

**2. Language Intensity:** There's high intensity on both ends: 'Love the coffee' (strong positive) and 'never been behind the counter' (absolute negative), 'every time' (emphasizing consistency), and 'huge slackers' (highly critical and judgmental). The contrast amplifies the dissatisfaction with service.

**3. Specific Feedback:**
*   **Positive:** Coffee quality is explicitly praised ('Love the coffee').
*   **Negative - Service:** Consistent issues with baristas not being ready to serve, requiring them to come in from a smoking patio, and engaging in 'chit chatting with your friends smoking' instead of working. This occurred 'Of the 4-3 times I have been in' and 'Every time that I have walked in,' indicating a systemic problem, not an isolated incident. The reviewer interprets this as staff being 'huge slackers.'
*   **Atmosphere:** Implied unprofessional atmosphere due to staff behavior on breaks near customer areas.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Despite loving the coffee, the severe and recurring service issues make it highly unlikely the reviewer would recommend the establishment, at least not without significant caveats about poor service. The tone suggests deep dissatisfaction that would deter a positive recommendation.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are significant. They relate to core operational aspects of a coffee shop: prompt service, staff presence, and professionalism. The issue is described as consistent across multiple visits, suggesting a systemic problem with staff management or training rather than a one-off bad experience. The perception of staff 'smoking and chit chatting' while customers wait is a major detractor for customer experience.

**Conclusion:** The excellent coffee is a significant positive, but it is severely undermined by the repeated and unprofessional service issues. The consistent absence of baristas, the need for them to return from smoking breaks, and the perception of laziness ('huge slackers') indicate a below-average overall experience, leading to a 2-star rating. The positives (coffee) prevent it from being a 1-star, but the overwhelming and consistent negatives regarding service push it far below an average (3-star) or good (4-star) rating.","```json

"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.",2,1,"This review exhibits a dominant emotional tone of profound disappointment, frustration, and disgust, despite initial enthusiasm for specific items. The language intensity is high, utilizing strong superlatives for both positive ('ridiculously good,' 'outstanding,' 'delicious') and overwhelmingly negative ('hilariously underwhelming,' 'lousy,' 'very disappointing,' 'foul,' 'true shame,' 'fails on almost everything,' 'needs to be on Restaurant Impossible... badly') experiences. Specific feedback is extensive and detailed across multiple areas.

Food positives are limited to the queso, homemade tortillas, and initial chips and salsa. However, the Tortilla Soup is described as 'hilariously underwhelming' and 'lousy,' resembling 'kitchen scraps.' The fajitas are criticized for under-grilled vegetables and a severe lack of peppers and onions, a concern also noted by another reviewer. The overall cuisine is deemed 'Americanized Mexican' and 'average at best' aside from a few standouts.

Service is explicitly called 'really lousy,' and a major incident involved a bug 'deep down in her water.' The waitress's response was inadequate, focusing on explaining away the bug rather than effective remediation, only deducting a soda for a significant hygiene issue. The atmosphere is condemned with the entry foyer smelling 'like a high school locker room' and 'foul.'

Recommendation likelihood is unequivocally negative; the reviewer states they 'may likely not return' and 'not sure if our family and friends... will either after the bug incident,' effectively warning others away. The complaint severity is extremely high, particularly regarding the bug in the water, the restaurant's poor handling of it, and the 'foul' smell in the entrance. These hygiene and service failures overshadow any minor food positives and indicate a fundamental issue with the establishment.

"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.

Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.",2,2,"The review presents a mixed sentiment, starting with clear positives for several items like homemade chips, red salsa, tender chicken, and the service. However, it shifts to strongly negative sentiment regarding key components: the green sauce is described as 'so blah' and 'couldn't eat it without dousing it,' and the beans and rice were 'disappointing.' The concluding phrase 'not impressed' solidifies an overall negative impression.

The language intensity for positives is mildly enthusiastic ('mmm,' 'tender,' 'liked'). For negatives, it uses stronger terms like 'so blah' (implying extreme lack of flavor), 'couldn't eat it without dousing it' (highlighting severity), and 'disappointing.' The final statement 'not impressed' is a clear, moderate-to-strong negative summarization.

Specific feedback includes positive mentions of homemade chips, red salsa, tender chicken in enchiladas, and service. Negative feedback targets the green sauce (lack of flavor, requiring modification to be edible), beans, and rice (disappointing). No specific feedback on atmosphere or value is provided. The reviewer also mentions a potential 'lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine' as a caveat, but this does not override their personal dissatisfaction.

Given the significant complaints about core food items (green sauce, beans, rice) and the concluding 'not impressed,' the reviewer would likely not recommend this restaurant to others, or at least would not enthusiastically endorse it. The issues raised are moderately severe, especially the green sauce being so bland it required intervention, and the staple sides being disappointing.

"Beatiful setting and good service.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to high, particularly on the negative side. Phrases like 'doesn't make up for,' 'average at best,' and the specific complaint that 'all three of ours were over cooked' convey significant dissatisfaction.

I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.,2,1,"The dominant sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing profound dissatisfaction across all mentioned aspects of the dining experience. The language intensity, while not using extreme superlatives for every single complaint, is consistently critical. The accumulation of multiple strong negative descriptors ('over-hyped,' 'overpriced,' 'low quality meat,' 'slow service,' 'sterile decor') without a single positive point creates an intensely negative and definitive tone.

"I happened on this place because it was next to EL Brava, a Mexican place recommended by the USAirways in flight magazine as a place to try in an airport. Getting to ElBrava we found it was a fast food stand with very little seating so this is next door. 

The menu was pretty limited. Service actually wasn't bad but, even though it wasn't busy, we waited a long, long time for our meal to get there.... something you don't expect in an airport. When the food got there it ok. I had a burger that was pricey and non memorable. 

Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!",2,2,"This Yelp review presents a predominantly negative sentiment with a clear recommendation against visiting. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of disappointment and frustration. While the reviewer notes service 'wasn't bad' initially, this is quickly overshadowed by significant complaints. Key negative emotions arise from the long wait time, the mediocre and overpriced food, and the overall forgettable experience.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to high on the negative side. Phrases like 'long, long time' (repetition for emphasis), 'something you don't expect in an airport' (highlighting critical failure), 'pricey and non memorable,' and the definitive closing 'Next time I'll... pass by the 12th!' convey strong dissatisfaction and a clear warning.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Context:** Chosen due to lack of seating at a neighboring, recommended fast-food spot.
    *   **Menu:** 'pretty limited.'
    *   **Service:** Initial interaction 'wasn't bad,' but the *delivery time* was a major issue ('waited a long, long time for our meal to get there'), critically problematic for an airport establishment.
    *   **Food Quality:** Described as 'it ok' (lukewarm at best) and the burger specifically as 'non memorable.'
    *   **Value:** 'pricey' for a 'non memorable' burger, indicating poor value.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!' This is a very strong, explicit statement against recommending or revisiting the establishment, effectively a negative recommendation.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The long wait time in an airport context is a severe complaint as it directly impacts travel plans and expectations. The food being 'ok' and 'non memorable' combined with being 'pricey' constitutes a moderate to severe complaint regarding quality and value. The limited menu is a minor complaint. The accumulation of these issues, particularly the critical service failure in an airport, makes the overall complaint severity high.

**Conclusion for Star Rating:** The review clearly falls into the 'Below average' category. There are significantly more negatives than positives. The reviewer is disappointed and explicitly states they are 'unlikely to return' and actively 'pass by' the place next time. While the food wasn't described as 'terrible' or 'inedible' (which would push it to 1 star), being 'ok' and 'non memorable' combined with a severe wait time and poor value makes it a very unsatisfactory experience, warranting 2 stars.","```json

Phrases like 'long, long time' (repetition for emphasis), 'something you don't expect in an airport' (highlighting critical failure), 'pricey and non memorable,' and the definitive closing 'Next time I'll... pass by the 12th!' convey strong dissatisfaction and a clear warning.\n\n3.  **Specific Feedback:**\n    *   **Context:** Chosen due to lack of seating at a neighboring, recommended fast-food spot.\n    *   **Menu:** 'pretty limited.'\n    *   **Service:** Initial interaction 'wasn't bad,' but the *delivery time* was a major issue ('waited a long, long time for our meal to get there'), critically problematic for an airport establishment.\n    *   **Food Quality:** Described as 'it ok' (lukewarm at best) and the burger specifically as 'non memorable.'\n    *   **Value:** 'pricey' for a 'non memorable' burger, indicating poor value.\n\n4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!' This is a very strong, explicit statement against recommending or revisiting the establishment, effectively a negative recommendation.\n\n5.  **Complaint Severity:** The long wait time in an airport context is a severe complaint as it directly impacts travel plans and expectations. The food being 'ok' and 'non memorable' combined with being 'pricey' constitutes a moderate to severe complaint regarding quality and value. The limited menu is a minor complaint. The accumulation of these issues, particularly the critical service failure in an airport, makes the overall complaint severity high.\n\n**Conclusion for Star Rating:** The review clearly falls into the 'Below average' category. There are significantly more negatives than positives. The reviewer is disappointed and explicitly states they are 'unlikely to return' and actively 'pass by' the place next time. While the food wasn't described as 'terrible' or 'inedible' (which would push it to 1 star), being 'ok' and 'non memorable' combined with a severe wait time and poor value makes it a very unsatisfactory experience, warranting 2 stars.""

"The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one? 

The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times.

The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?

There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.


12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our ""snack"" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)",2,2,"The review demonstrates a predominantly negative and frustrated sentiment towards this particular Starbucks location, despite a general affection for the brand. The language intensity is high, using strong negative descriptors such as 'leaves a lot to be desired,' 'almost rude,' 'annoyed to be busy,' 'take forever to make,' 'messed up the last 2 times,' and 'main issue.'

Specific feedback is provided across multiple critical areas:
*   **Service:** Repeated complaints about rude staff demeanor, slowness in drink preparation, and significant order inaccuracy (messed up the last 2 times).
*   **Atmosphere/Operational Management:** A major recurring complaint about staff sweeping the floor directly near patrons '3 out of 5 times,' disrupting their relaxation.

Initially, the recommendation likelihood is very low, with the reviewer explicitly stating their intention to 'try some others locally.' The update provides a cautious, slightly positive note ('wanted to say things were better today'), but the reviewer explicitly states they are 'not going to change my rating until after my next visit,' indicating that the core negative experience and associated low recommendation still stand.

The complaint severity is high. Issues like rude service, persistent order errors, and disruptive cleaning practices are not minor inconveniences but fundamental failures in customer service and operational standards. These deeply impact the overall customer experience and represent systemic problems.

While the update offers a glimmer of potential improvement, the overwhelming number and severity of long-standing complaints, coupled with the reviewer's intention to seek out other locations, firmly place this experience in the 'below average, more negatives than positives, disappointed, unlikely to return' category. It avoids a 1-star rating due to the very recent, albeit tentative, positive remark.","```json

"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy!

""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they don't have to be greedy about it!",2,1,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly negative sentiment with extreme language intensity, indicating a terrible experience.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of intense anger, disbelief, frustration, and strong disappointment. Phrases like 'Are you serious?', 'Cra-zy!', 'worst sliders ever', and accusing the establishment of being 'greedy' clearly convey this.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language intensity is very high. The reviewer uses multiple exclamations, direct rhetorical questions ('Are you serious?'), and strong negative superlatives ('worst sliders ever'). Comparisons to grocery store prices (6-pack for the price of one beer) and fast-food quality (Jack in the Box sliders are better) are employed to emphasize extreme dissatisfaction and poor value/quality. The term 'greedy' is a strong accusation.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details across multiple aspects:
    *   **Value/Price:** Specific prices are mentioned for domestic beers ($4.50 for Old Style during happy hour) and imported beer ($5.50 for Corona). The reviewer contrasts these with grocery store prices ($4.50 for a 6-pack of Old Style).
    *   **Food Quality/Taste:** Sliders are described as 'the worst sliders ever' and explicitly compared unfavorably to 'Jack in the Box sliders'.
    *   **Food Details/Portion:** Specific issues with the 'southwestern sliders' include: almost $10 for six, 'patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun', 'one jalapeno', 'a small square of cheese', and 'salsa to make the bun soggy'.
    *   **Atmosphere/Location (Indirect):** The 'prime location right outside of the ballpark' is acknowledged but used as a point of contention regarding pricing rather than a positive aspect of the atmosphere.
    *   No positive feedback whatsoever is provided.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The likelihood of recommendation is extremely low. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction and implicitly warns others away, questioning the establishment's pricing ethics and product quality. There is no indication they would return or recommend it.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are highly severe and cover critical aspects of a dining experience:
    *   **Value for Money:** Perceived as exorbitant and 'greedy', especially for common items and during 'happy hour'.
    *   **Food Quality:** Described as terrible, worse than fast food, with specific failings in portion size, ingredient quality, and preparation.
    *   These issues represent fundamental failures in meeting customer expectations for both price and product.","```json

"My friends and I got a 10-person karaoke room and ordered food while we sang. The room is SMALL --in other K places I've been to, that would have been a room for 5 people. With 10 people in there, we turned into a sweaty airless mess very quickly. Secondly, their song choices are not good. They're behind about 2 years. Had we known, we would not have gone there. The food was mediocre; I've had better sushi. A room rental comes with a complimentary sushi platter, which was one roll (no idea what it was, even though i ate a piece); some edamame; two ribs. I ate the edamame; they weren't cooked through because they were hard and had that slightly spicy raw taste. 

We went on a Friday and it was packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags. At least the servers were very sweet, even though they messed up drink orders once and the bill once.",2,1,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The reviewer uses strong, critical language throughout, indicating significant dissatisfaction. Key complaints include the room being 'SMALL' and leading to a 'sweaty airless mess' for 10 people, 'not good' and 'behind about 2 years' song choices (a fundamental flaw for a karaoke establishment), 'mediocre' sushi, and severely 'undercooked' edamame with a 'raw taste.' The complimentary platter is described as sparse and ambiguous. The atmosphere is also criticized as 'packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags.' The only positive feedback pertains to the servers' demeanor ('very sweet'), which is immediately tempered by operational mistakes ('messed up drink orders once and the bill once'). The most impactful statement, 'Had we known, we would not have gone there,' clearly signals a strong disrecommendation and regret. The issues raised are severe, impacting comfort, core service offering, food quality, and value.

"Last summer when I was in AZ I ate here a few times and it was always great!  I love the pulled pork sandwich.  I ate here while I had family in town a few weeks ago and it was nothing like it used to be.  The sandwich was lacking in flavor, they didn't have the same sides they used to.  We got these fried potatoes which had way to much seasoning on them, none of us ate them.  This place has gone way down hill, I won't be going here anymore.",2,1,"This review exhibits a strong shift from past positive experiences to extreme current dissatisfaction. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The initial sentiment is highly positive and nostalgic ('always great!', 'love the pulled pork sandwich'). However, the dominant and concluding sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by deep disappointment, frustration, and finality ('nothing like it used to be', 'lacking in flavor', 'way too much seasoning', 'none of us ate them', 'gone way down hill', 'won't be going here anymore').

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language for the past experience is enthusiastic ('always great!', 'love'). For the recent experience, it becomes highly intense and definitive, using strong negative phrases and absolutes: 'nothing like it used to be', 'lacking in flavor', 'way too much seasoning', 'none of us ate them' (indicating inedible food), 'gone way down hill', and a conclusive 'I won't be going here anymore.'

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details regarding food quality and consistency. The pulled pork sandwich, a former favorite, was 'lacking in flavor.' There's a complaint about changes in sides, specifically mentioning 'fried potatoes' that had 'way too much seasoning' to the point that 'none of us ate them.' This highlights specific failures in key food items.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'I won't be going here anymore.' This is a firm non-recommendation and serves as a strong warning against visiting, especially for anyone expecting the quality the reviewer once experienced.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are very severe. 'Lacking in flavor' for a signature dish is a fundamental flaw, and 'way too much seasoning' leading to 'none of us ate them' indicates an item that was essentially inedible. The overall assessment that the 'place has gone way down hill' suggests a significant and systemic decline in quality. 

**Predicted Stars Rationale:** While the reviewer acknowledges positive past experiences, these serve primarily to highlight the drastic negative change. The recent visit was characterized by severe food quality issues (lacking flavor, inedible sides) and strong, definitive negative language, culminating in an explicit refusal to return. This level of disappointment, combined with concrete, critical failures in food preparation and a clear warning to others, aligns with a 1-star rating.","```json

"The ""chicken burger"" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there.

"Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated ""Thai hot"" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.",3,3,"This review presents a mixed bag of feedback, characteristic of an average or neutral experience. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed. There are clear positives regarding the ambiance ('Enjoyed dinner on the patio', 'ambiance of their patio was enjoyable') and the freshness of ingredients ('seafood ... was very fresh'). However, significant negatives emerge concerning the actual taste and execution of the food ('mediocre at best' for the ginger fish, 'dishes looked better than they actually tasted', 'wasn't Thai hot at all' for the dish advertised as such, 'wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food'). Even the positive mention of the Thai iced tea is tempered by it being 'a little too sweet towards the end'.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate. Phrases like 'mediocre at best' and 'wasn't Thai hot at all' indicate clear disappointment and a failure to meet expectations. 'Very fresh' and 'very tasty' are strong positives. However, the overall conclusion 'wasn't very impressed' is a milder form of disappointment, and 'probably give this restaurant another try' suggests a hesitant, rather than enthusiastic, willingness to return.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides excellent specific feedback:
    *   **Food Quality:** Pad Cha Seafood (fresh seafood, not hot as advertised); Ginger Fish (mediocre taste, good presentation with vegetables and pineapple); general observation that food looked better than it tasted; Thai Iced Tea (tasty but too sweet at the end).
    *   **Service:** Not mentioned.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Patio ambiance was enjoyable.
    *   **Value:** Not mentioned.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer states, 'Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future'. This indicates a conditional willingness to return, but it's not a strong recommendation to others. It suggests a neutral stance – not enough to fully recommend, but not enough to warn others away completely either.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are moderately severe. The core issue is the taste of the food not meeting expectations, especially for the 'hottest dish' not being hot, and one dish being 'mediocre at best'. These directly impact the primary reason for visiting a restaurant (the food). While not issues of hygiene or poor service, they are significant enough to detract from the experience without being catastrophic.

**Conclusion:** The review balances noticeable positives (ambiance, freshness) with clear negatives about the food's taste and execution. The reviewer's willingness to 'probably' return, despite being 'not very impressed with the taste of the food', aligns perfectly with a mixed or average experience, leading to a 3-star prediction.","```json

Sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.",3,3,"This review presents a mixed but highly specific experience. The reviewer explicitly states a desire to give 4 stars, indicating an overall positive inclination towards the store. However, a consistent and recurring negative issue with the deli sandwich bread (stale 1 out of 3 times over several months) prevents them from doing so. This indicates the issue is significant enough to pull down their intended rating. 

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed, with strong positive sentiment for the majority of the store's offerings (produce, meats, seafood, cheeses) contrasted by frustration and disappointment regarding a specific recurring food quality issue at the deli. The reviewer expresses a desire for improvement to achieve happiness.

**Language Intensity:** The language used is quite strong on the positive side, with 'great' being used three times to describe the farmer's market concept, produce selection, and quality of meats, seafood, and cheeses. On the negative side, 'stale' is a direct and impactful descriptor for food quality, and 'can't do it' conveys a firm decision based on dissatisfaction.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Positive:** Excellent feedback for the store's core offerings: described as a 'great farmer's market,' with a 'great selection of produce,' and 'great meats, seafood and cheeses.' This covers product variety and quality for most of the store.
*   **Negative:** Very specific feedback regarding the deli: the bread for sandwiches is 'stale 1 out of 3 times' and this has been consistent 'over the past few months.' This is a concrete, frequent, and recurring quality issue.

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would likely recommend the store for its general grocery offerings (produce, meats, etc.) given the strong positive feedback in those areas. However, they would almost certainly caution against or avoid recommending the deli sandwiches due to the recurring stale bread issue. Their willingness to be 'happy' if the bread issue is fixed suggests they are a returning customer who wants to continue patronizing the store.

**Complaint Severity:** The complaint about stale bread is moderately severe. It directly impacts food quality for a specific product and is frequent (33% of visits for that item) and recurring over time. While significant for the deli department, it does not taint the reviewer's otherwise enthusiastic praise for the rest of the store. The fact that this single issue prevents a higher rating signifies its impact on the overall experience.

**Predicted Stars Rationale:** The explicit statement 'I really want to gives this Sprout's location 4 stars but... I can't do it' immediately places the review below a 4-star rating. While the positive aspects are extensive and strongly worded, the recurring, specific negative issue is impactful enough to prevent a 'very good experience' (4 stars). A 2-star rating would imply more negatives than positives and disappointment, which isn't the case given the strong praise for most departments. Therefore, a 3-star rating, representing a 'mixed experience' with balanced significant positives and negatives (where the negative is potent enough to lower an otherwise higher rating), is the most accurate reflection.","```json

"The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe I'll write another review when something outrageous happens :)",3,3,"1. **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is neutral, with a slight positive lean due to acknowledging staff politeness. However, this is immediately balanced by the explicit statement, 'nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either,' which solidifies a neutral, unenthusiastic sentiment. The closing remark about waiting for 'something outrageous' further reinforces the current lack of a strong positive or negative impression.
2. **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is low to moderate. Words like 'polite' are positive but not exceptionally strong. There are no superlatives or highly emotional descriptors used to convey either extreme delight or extreme dissatisfaction. The hypothetical use of 'outrageous' underscores the current absence of any intense experience.
3. **Specific Feedback:** The review offers specific, albeit brief, feedback on staff conduct, noting that employees across different roles ('stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter') have been 'polite.' Beyond this, the feedback is very general, indicating an overall average experience without delving into details about product quality, atmosphere, value, or specific incidents.
4. **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer maintains a neutral stance regarding recommendation. They neither enthusiastically recommend the establishment nor warn others away. The phrase 'nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either' suggests a lack of compelling reasons for a strong recommendation, but also no reasons to dissuade. The 'Keep perservering' offers mild encouragement but implies room for improvement rather than current advocacy.
5. **Complaint Severity:** There are no complaints mentioned in the review. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I have nothing really bad to say.' The absence of a 'great' experience is framed as an observation of neutrality, not a grievance or a serious issue. Thus, the complaint severity is none.","```json

"I'm somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp ""Talk"" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I won't be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco)

First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They weren't busy. 

We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!

But, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!",3,4,"The reviewer explicitly states they are 'somewhere in between three and four stars,' providing a clear guideline. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed, leaning slightly positive. There's a conversational, almost humorous, and reflective tone, even when detailing complaints. The reviewer clearly enjoys certain aspects immensely, particularly the ambiance and social experience, which offsets the service frustrations.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is high for positive aspects related to atmosphere and company, using superlatives like 'rocking good' (patio), 'perfect' (trees/leaves), and 'phenomenal' (people watching). For negatives, the intensity is moderate ('eh, poor to okay' for service, 'no' for wine, 'eh, okay' for menu). The contrast between the strong positives and moderate negatives helps frame the overall impression.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Service:** Clearly negative, requiring the reviewer to approach the bar for service, refills, and the check, despite the establishment being largely empty. Rated 'poor to okay.'
    *   **Atmosphere:** Overwhelmingly positive. 'Cute, compartmentalized rooms,' 'homey feel,' 'rocking good' patio, 'perfect' changing trees, 'phenomenal' people-watching.
    *   **Food & Drink:** Mixed. 'Good selection of beer, yes,' 'Good wine, no,' 'Well made cocktails, yes,' 'Menu, eh, okay,' 'Fish and Chips, pretty good.'
    *   **Value:** Not directly addressed, but implied through the mixed food/drink feedback.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** While not a direct 'I recommend,' the reviewer suggests 'go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown... and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner,' indicating a willingness to return or recommend it for specific purposes (patio, drinks, ambiance) despite the service flaws. This implies a conditional, but overall positive, likelihood of recommendation.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The service issues are notable and a significant detractor. The poor wine selection is also a clear negative. However, these complaints are presented without extreme anger or indignation. They are inconveniences rather than deal-breakers, especially when weighed against the strongly positive aspects of the ambiance and the enjoyment derived from the company and people-watching. The complaints are 'minor issues' within the context of an otherwise 'very good experience' for specific elements.","```json

"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience.",3,4,"This review presents a complex scenario, starting with a significant negative incident that is effectively mitigated. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is remarkably positive despite a 'gross' incident. While the discovery of a bug initially 'grossed me out,' the reviewer quickly adopts an 'understanding' and forgiving stance ('not necessarily their fault'). The sentiment becomes strongly positive when describing the manager's actions (apology, compensation, offer) and the rest of the meal ('great,' 'Yummy!'). The overall sentiment towards the restaurant brand remains positive ('I do like Pappadeaux's overall').

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is mixed. 'Grossed me out' is a strong negative, but it is counterbalanced by equally strong positives like 'great' (used twice for the meal) and 'Yummy!' for the food. The description of the manager's response implies excellent service recovery, which is a strong positive.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details: a 'flying bug that landed in my dessert and died,' the specific food item ('scallops with green beans and capers'), and the clear actions taken by the manager (apology, dessert removed from bill, offer of another dessert). This offers specific insights into food quality (despite the bug, the main meal was good) and exceptional service recovery.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer expresses a high likelihood of returning and maintaining their patronage, stating, 'I do like Pappadeaux's overall' and framing the incident as a rare occurrence ('this is the first time I didn't have a great experience'). The effective resolution of the issue reinforces this likelihood.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The presence of a bug in food is objectively a severe hygiene issue that could warrant a very low rating. However, the severity of the *complaint's impact* is significantly reduced by two factors: the reviewer's understanding ('not necessarily their fault') and, more importantly, the restaurant's swift and effective service recovery. The manager's actions turned a potentially disastrous experience into one that was professionally handled.

**Conclusion:** While a bug in food is a serious issue, the reviewer's understanding, the restaurant's excellent service recovery, and the overwhelmingly positive experience with the main meal prevent this from being a low-star review. The incident was an anomaly, and the restaurant managed to recover gracefully, leaving the reviewer with a generally positive impression, albeit not 'exceptional' due to the initial shock. A 4-star rating reflects a very good experience with a significant issue that was well-managed, leading to a likely return.","```json

"All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.",3,3,"The reviewer explicitly states a 3-star rating, which aligns with an average/mixed experience. The sentiment is highly polarized. On one hand, there's intense negative sentiment regarding a specific service encounter, with the reviewer using strong, critical language to describe a staff member as potentially impaired ('on something pretty heavy', 'so blitzed out of her mind'), unable to interact effectively ('barely able to interact', 'asked us 5 times how we were doing' in 2 minutes, 'never once made eye contact'), and having a poor appearance ('pretty filthy') and demeanor ('really rude'). This interaction was so severe it 'turned us off so bad' that the entire party decided not to order anything, indicating a significant service failure and direct loss of business for that visit. The complaint severity is very high due to accusations of impairment and lack of basic professional conduct, leading to a complete breakdown of service.

"I am not happy with Sprinkles, but I can't really subtract stars because I make better cupcakes than they do.  Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need ""personality"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.

As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.

The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.

Sprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.",3,2,"The reviewer expresses a clear sentiment of dissatisfaction with Sprinkles, stating outright 'I am not happy with Sprinkles' and 'I don't like you. I will not be back.' While attempting to be fair by disclaiming personal biases (making better cupcakes, hating Scottsdale, location being 'stupid'), the core evaluation of the cupcakes themselves is predominantly negative.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is negative and disappointed. Keywords like 'not happy,' 'stupid' (for location), 'pissed me off,' 'meh,' 'not what I had hoped for,' and 'I don't like you' convey strong displeasure. There are minor positive mentions of frosting texture and jimmies for the peanut butter chocolate, but these are significantly overshadowed by the criticisms.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to high. Phrases like 'very stupid,' 'pissed me off,' and 'I don't like you' are strong. Detailed descriptive critiques ('lacked the subtle cocoa flavor,' 'barely tangy,' 'super sweet, slightly grainy,' 'crust on the top from sitting out too long') demonstrate specific and intense dissatisfaction with product quality.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides abundant and concrete details:
    *   **Location/Atmosphere:** Described as 'very stupid,' 'easy to miss,' blending in, and having 'no personality.'
    *   **Food - Red Velvet:** Criticized for being 'very plain,' lacking cocoa and buttermilk tang, tasting 'red and cake.' A major complaint was the 'cupcake crown popped off' upon picking it up, which 'ruined my first bite.' The cream cheese frosting was 'so-so,' 'barely tangy,' 'super sweet,' 'slightly grainy,' and had a 'crust on the top from sitting out too long.'
    *   **Food - Peanut Butter Chocolate:** Described as 'not what I had hoped for.' The cake was 'very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.' The chocolate frosting's texture was 'nice and smooth,' and the reviewer liked the 'chocolate jimmies.' However, overall, it was 'just okay' and the reviewer wished for a saltier cake to balance the sweetness.
    *   **Service/Value:** Not mentioned.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely low. The reviewer explicitly states, 'Sprinkles, I will not be back. I don't like you.' This is a definitive statement against returning or recommending.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are significant. The cupcake crown issue is a serious structural/presentation flaw that impacted the eating experience. The detailed critiques of flavor balance (lack of specific flavors, lack of sugar, excessive sweetness), texture (grainy, dense), and freshness (crust on frosting) point to fundamental issues with the product quality. These are not minor inconveniences but substantial failures in delivering a good cupcake.

**Conclusion:** Despite the reviewer's attempt to compartmentalize personal preferences, the core experience with the cupcakes was overwhelmingly negative and disappointing. Multiple specific issues were identified with both cupcakes, indicating a below-average experience that resulted in a firm decision not to return. This aligns closely with a 2-star rating, signifying 'below average, more negatives than positives, disappointed, unlikely to return.'","```json

The cupcake crown issue is a serious structural/presentation flaw that impacted the eating experience. The detailed critiques of flavor balance (lack of specific flavors, lack of sugar, excessive sweetness), texture (grainy, dense), and freshness (crust on frosting) point to fundamental issues with the product quality. These are not minor inconveniences but substantial failures in delivering a good cupcake.\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the reviewer's attempt to compartmentalize personal preferences, the core experience with the cupcakes was overwhelmingly negative and disappointing. Multiple specific issues were identified with both cupcakes, indicating a below-average experience that resulted in a firm decision not to return. This aligns closely with a 2-star rating, signifying 'below average, more negatives than positives, disappointed, unlikely to return.'""

"* 5 stars for uniqueness - This place has very interesting food and flavors that aren't common around here.

* 5 stars for the staff - Everybody was very fast and friendly.

* 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - I mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100-year-old house in a cool part of downtown Phoenix.  Parking is a pain though.

However.....

Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.",3,2,"This review presents a stark contrast between initial positive impressions and a deeply negative concluding sentiment regarding value. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone shifts from highly positive regarding specific attributes (uniqueness, staff, atmosphere) to strongly negative concerning value, satisfaction, and cost. Phrases like 'hungry and ripped off' convey severe disappointment.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses superlatives for positives ('very interesting', 'very fast and friendly', 'pretty cool') but employs equally strong, if not stronger, negative language ('pain' for parking, 'hungry and ripped off', 'would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person'). The 'However.....' acts as a strong pivot, indicating a fundamental issue.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Positives:** Unique food/flavors, fast and friendly staff, cool location/atmosphere (redone 100-year-old house, downtown Phoenix, hip/cool/urban/trendy vibe).
    *   **Negatives:** Parking is a pain (minor). The primary, severe negative is the poor value proposition – feeling hungry and ripped off due to small tapas portions leading to a very high cost ($100+ per person) for a full meal.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would *not* recommend this as a place for a full dinner. Their recommendation is highly constrained: 'more of a fun/interesting place to go *before* you go out to dinner.' This indicates a failure in its primary function as a dinner restaurant and suggests a very low likelihood of returning for a complete dining experience.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints about feeling 'hungry and ripped off' due to cost and portion size are very severe for a dining establishment. While parking is a minor inconvenience, the core issue of value and satisfaction undermines all the initial positives. The establishment fails to deliver a satisfying meal experience at what the reviewer considers a reasonable price point, making it fundamentally flawed in their eyes.

**Overall Justification for 2 Stars:** Despite the initial three 5-star categorical ratings, the overall experience is significantly soured by the severe complaints about value and portion size leading to hunger and feeling 'ripped off.' For a restaurant, failing on the fundamental aspect of providing a satisfying meal at a perceived fair price is critical. The concluding statement, effectively relegating the place to a pre-dinner stop rather than a dinner destination, clearly demonstrates a below-average experience for its intended purpose. The positive aspects are outweighed by the profound disappointment in the core value proposition.","```json

"I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. 

Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.

Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. 
Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. 
Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. 

If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.",3,1,"The reviewer presents an overwhelmingly negative experience, signaling a dramatic decline from their past affection for the establishment. There are no positive aspects mentioned, only a litany of serious complaints.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of deep disappointment, alarm, and strong dissatisfaction. Phrases like ""Not so much any longer,"" ""Very bizarre,"" ""tired, worn out,"" ""a bit tattered, along with the staff,"" and a vivid description of a ""very young, very drunk"" crowd convey a powerful negative sentiment and a sense of decline.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language is highly intense, using strong, often alarming, negative descriptors. The waitress being described as ""on something"" and ""out of it"" implies severe impairment and is a critical accusation. The repeated forgetting of orders and inability to remember them is presented with urgency and concern. The contrast between the past ""spotless, and shiny"" state and the current ""tattered"" appearance, along with the comparison to a ""spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo,"" all contribute to a very high intensity in expressing negative feelings and disillusionment.

**3. Specific Feedback:** Concrete details are provided for several critical aspects:
    *   **Service:** The waitress was perceived as severely impaired (""on something,"" ""out of it"") and incompetent, forgetting the order twice and completely lacking memory of interactions.
    *   **Safety/Atmosphere:** A patron falling over and *no one* (staff or otherwise) seeming to notice indicates a significant lapse in safety oversight and an uncontrolled, chaotic environment. The reviewer infers this ""happens often here now.""
    *   **Ambiance/Decor:** The place is described as ""tired, worn out,"" with specific mention of ""tattered"" fabric on chairs and booths, contrasting sharply with a remembered pristine past.
    *   **Clientele:** The crowd is characterized as ""Very young, very drunk,"" creating an unwelcome and alienating environment for those ""over 28."" This specifies the target audience has drastically shifted.
    *   **Food Quality:** Notably, food quality is not mentioned, as the severe issues with service and atmosphere completely overshadowed any other potential focus.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, ""used to love the place. Not so much any longer,"" which is a clear indication they would *not* recommend it now. The entire review serves as a strong implicit warning, particularly for an older demographic, anyone expecting competent service, or a safe and well-maintained establishment. There is absolutely no positive inclination for a return visit or recommendation.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are extremely severe. Allegations of staff impairment affecting service are critical and raise serious concerns about professionalism and potential safety. A customer falling over and *no one noticing* points to a profound lack of safety protocols, staff attentiveness, and potentially an unmanaged environment. The decline in physical appearance and the description of a chaotic, overly-intoxicated crowd further compound these serious issues. These are not minor inconveniences but fundamental failures in hospitality, safety, and operational management. The reviewer strongly warns others away, particularly a specific demographic.","```json

I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.,3,2,"This review presents a predominantly negative experience, despite a few positive points. The structured evaluation is as follows:

1.  **Sentiment Analysis**: The dominant emotional tone is one of disappointment, annoyance, and even shock. While the reviewer initially notes being seated quickly and enjoys specific food items (rice, chicken dishes, bread), these positive sentiments are heavily outweighed by frustration regarding service delays, strong disapproval and discomfort over the owner's child disturbing the dining area, and clear dissatisfaction with specific food items (fish dishes). The overall sentiment concludes with a decisive negative stance.

2.  **Language Intensity**: The reviewer uses moderately intense language to convey their dissatisfaction. Phrases like 'good 10 minutes' emphasize the waiting time. Stronger, more emotional language is employed when discussing the child: 'just does not need to happen,' 'kind of shocked,' and a direct, somewhat indignant plea, 'please leave your kids at home.' Food complaints use descriptors like 'not so good,' 'cold and not good,' and 'super fishy tasteing.' The closing statements, 'I will not be going back anytime soon' and 'nothing to write home about,' are definitive and underscore a profoundly unimpressive and unrecommendable experience. There are no superlatives used for the positive aspects.

3.  **Specific Feedback**:
    *   **Service**: Mixed. The reviewer was seated immediately (positive) but then ignored for 'a good 10 minutes' (negative), forcing them to initiate service for the buffet (negative).
    *   **Atmosphere/Professionalism**: Highly negative. The presence of the owner's child sitting with customers and subsequently crying was a significant point of contention, deeply impacting the reviewer's experience and perceived professionalism of the establishment.
    *   **Food Quality**: Mixed. Positives included enjoying the 'rice and the chicken dishes' and finding the 'bread was really good.' Negatives were specific and severe for the fish dishes, described as 'not so good,' 'cold and not good' (fish puffs), and having a 'super fishy tasteing' (another fish dish).
    *   **Value**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the overwhelming negative experience suggests a lack of perceived value for the cost.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood**: The reviewer explicitly states, 'I will not be going back anytime soon,' and concludes with 'nothing to write home about.' This indicates a very low, effectively zero, likelihood of returning or recommending the restaurant to others.

5.  **Complaint Severity**: The complaints range from moderate to high severity. The 10-minute wait for service is a moderate issue. The incident with the owner's child causing a disturbance is a high-severity complaint for atmosphere and professionalism, leading to the reviewer feeling 'shocked.' The food complaints regarding cold and unpleasantly 'super fishy' fish are also of moderate to high severity, directly impacting the quality of the meal. The combination of these issues results in a significantly negative overall experience.

**Conclusion**: The review clearly indicates a below-average experience with more negatives than positives. The significant issues with service, the highly problematic atmospheric disturbance caused by the owner's child, and specific, severe complaints about food quality (the fish dishes) far outweigh the enjoyment of other food items. The reviewer's explicit decision not to return and the 'nothing to write home about' summation solidify a score reflecting disappointment and an unlikely return, aligning well with a 2-star rating.","```json

"Buffet is great, Good Selection of food even for me the picky Vegetarian. Naan tastes great, choice of plain or Garlic Naan. Food generally tastes good. Rating on Buffet alone, I would have given 4 stars.

However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.

Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those) 

The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.

Good place for the lunch buffet.",3,2,"This review presents a highly polarized experience, making the overall star prediction a balance between distinct positive and negative feedback. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is split. For the lunch buffet, the sentiment is strongly positive, expressing satisfaction and enjoyment. However, for dinner and take-out experiences, the sentiment shifts dramatically to strong disappointment, frustration, and disgust, particularly regarding value and quality.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses moderately positive language for the buffet ('great', 'Good Selection', 'tastes great'). In contrast, for dinner and take-out, the language becomes much more intense and negative: 'might not return', 'well above $10', 'god I hate those' (referring to frozen vegetables), 'about half' (quantity issue), 'sub-par', and 'burnt' (naan). The sarcastic comment 'Can I pay you a little less than the bill?' further emphasizes their extreme dissatisfaction with the take-out experience.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Positives (Lunch Buffet):** Great buffet, good selection of food (even for picky vegetarians), naan tastes great (plain/garlic options), food generally tastes good. Hypothetically rated 4 stars on its own.
    *   **Negatives (Dinner/Take-out):** Dinner entries are overpriced (above $10) and use low-quality frozen vegetables ('crinkle cut carrots' specifically hated). Take-out quantity was halved compared to a previous order, food tasted sub-par, and naan was burnt. These issues led the reviewer to state they 'get only 1 star' for this experience.
    *   **Value:** Good for buffet, poor for dinner (overpriced for quality), extremely poor for take-out (half quantity, sub-par food).
    *   **Food Quality:** Excellent for buffet, poor for dinner (frozen veg), very poor for take-out (sub-par taste, burnt naan).

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Good place for the lunch buffet,' indicating a strong recommendation for that specific offering. However, they also state, 'However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out,' indicating a strong unlikelihood of returning or recommending for these services. The overall recommendation is severely hampered by the negative experiences.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are severe. The use of 'crinkle cut carrots' and the 'god I hate those' sentiment highlights a significant quality issue for dinner. For take-out, having the quantity cut in half is a major value and potentially deceptive issue, while sub-par food and burnt naan represent critical failures in quality control. These are not minor issues but fundamental problems that severely impact the overall experience outside of the buffet.

**Overall Justification for 2 Stars:** The review explicitly presents two distinct experiences: a 4-star buffet and a 1-star dinner/take-out. While the buffet is highly praised, the severe and fundamental issues encountered with dinner and take-out (poor value, drastically reduced quantity, sub-par quality, burnt items) significantly detract from the restaurant's overall appeal. The reviewer's decision to 'not return there for Dinner or Take-out' indicates that these negative aspects outweigh the positives for a significant portion of the business. A 2-star rating reflects a 'below average' experience where the numerous and severe negatives for key services override the positive aspects of the buffet, leading to disappointment and an unlikelihood to return for comprehensive dining.","```json

"Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars. 
My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Morton's and Mastro's) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durant's had great reviews. 
When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then you're greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere.
Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.",3,2,"The review presents a distinctly mixed experience, with extreme highs for service and ambiance, but significant lows for the main courses, which were the primary reason for the visit. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed, with strong positivity for the service and atmosphere ('awesome!!', 'pretty cool', '5 stars (so rare)'), contrasted with clear disappointment and negativity regarding the main food items ('very bland', 'also bland'). The dessert, however, elicited a very positive response ('the best part of the meal!').

**2. Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses high-intensity language for both positive and negative aspects. Superlatives like 'so rare' (for 5-star service), 'awesome!!' (for waiter Fred), and 'best part of the meal!' (for dessert) highlight the exceptional aspects. On the negative side, 'very bland' and 'also bland' are strong descriptors indicating significant dissatisfaction with the core dishes. The surprise at the rib-eye being bland further emphasizes this.

**3. Specific Feedback:**
*   **Food Quality:** Explicitly rated 2.5 stars by the reviewer. Soup was 'good but salty', trout was 'very bland', and the rib-eye was 'also bland' (a significant issue given their preference for high-end steakhouses). The 'trio creme brulee' was the 'best part of the meal!'. This detailed feedback clearly outlines where the food fell short, especially concerning the main courses.
*   **Service:** Rated 5 stars. Described as 'awesome!! Very friendly and professional' (Fred). The overall staff (host, kitchen, waiters) provided a welcoming experience, with 'every single person' greeting them.
*   **Atmosphere:** Described as 'pretty cool', 'burlesque-ish', with 'deep red' walls and 'huge vases of roses'. Walking through the kitchen was also noted as 'pretty cool'.
*   **Value:** Not directly mentioned, but the implied value for the bland main courses, especially in a steakhouse context for picky eaters, is likely perceived as poor.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.' This is a strong *non-recommendation* for the restaurant's primary offering (steak) and indicates they will not return for that purpose. While they might recommend the service or dessert, the core reason for visiting was not met, making an overall recommendation unlikely.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints regarding the main courses (bland trout and rib-eye) are severe, as they directly contradict the expectations of a steakhouse, especially for patrons accustomed to high-quality steak. This fundamental failure in the core product significantly overshadows the excellent service and atmosphere. The saltiness of the soup is a minor complaint in comparison. The severity of the food complaints directly led to the decision not to return for steak.

Considering the exceptional service and ambiance were offset by a critical failure in the main courses (the primary reason for visiting a 'steakplace'), and the explicit decision not to return for steak, the overall experience leans heavily towards disappointment despite the positives. This aligns with a 2-star rating, signifying a below-average experience with more negatives than positives concerning the core offering, and an unlikelihood of return for their main purpose.","```json

Soup was 'good but salty', trout was 'very bland', and the rib-eye was 'also bland' (a significant issue given their preference for high-end steakhouses). The 'trio creme brulee' was the 'best part of the meal!'. This detailed feedback clearly outlines where the food fell short, especially concerning the main courses.\n*   **Service:** Rated 5 stars. Described as 'awesome!! Very friendly and professional' (Fred). The overall staff (host, kitchen, waiters) provided a welcoming experience, with 'every single person' greeting them.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Described as 'pretty cool', 'burlesque-ish', with 'deep red' walls and 'huge vases of roses'. Walking through the kitchen was also noted as 'pretty cool'.\n*   **Value:** Not directly mentioned, but the implied value for the bland main courses, especially in a steakhouse context for picky eaters, is likely perceived as poor.\n\n**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.' This is a strong *non-recommendation* for the restaurant's primary offering (steak) and indicates they will not return for that purpose. While they might recommend the service or dessert, the core reason for visiting was not met, making an overall recommendation unlikely.\n\n**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints regarding the main courses (bland trout and rib-eye) are severe, as they directly contradict the expectations of a steakhouse, especially for patrons accustomed to high-quality steak. This fundamental failure in the core product significantly overshadows the excellent service and atmosphere. The saltiness of the soup is a minor complaint in comparison. The severity of the food complaints directly led to the decision not to return for steak.\n\nConsidering the exceptional service and ambiance were offset by a critical failure in the main courses (the primary reason for visiting a 'steakplace'), and the explicit decision not to return for steak, the overall experience leans heavily towards disappointment despite the positives. This aligns with a 2-star rating, signifying a below-average experience with more negatives than positives concerning the core offering, and an unlikelihood of return for their main purpose.""

"what better way to end a perfect Spring training baseball day than with a marg, Mexican food and your girlfriends...
the local in the group said this place would be crowded on a Sat night, so we weren't surprised with the wait time, but if a place is used to being crowded....they should have a better wait plan. if the bar is full (which it was for a bit), there is not much space to hang and wait, once we got to our table, our waitress spaced....got us water and then never came back. i liked the menu, as it spiced up some of the normal Mexican fare...like the shrimp chilaquiles with chipotle cream sauce that was great! the guac is good, but deceiving as it comes out in this huge mound served in a pestle...in actuality, there is a lot of lettuce on bottom then cup of guac. and my house margarita was more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.

i think this place has potential and i might try it again if i could do it on a weeknight, but for now it just gets my average.",3,3,"The reviewer presents a mixed experience, balancing significant complaints with some positive notes. The initial sentiment is positive, setting a scene for a good evening, and the menu itself is appreciated for 'spicing up' normal fare, with the shrimp chilaquiles specifically called 'great!'. This positive food feedback provides a strong anchor.

However, several critical issues are raised. The 'wait plan' is deemed poor, and there's a significant service lapse where the 'waitress spaced....got us water and then never came back.' This is a severe complaint. The guacamole is criticized as 'deceiving' due to its presentation hiding a smaller portion, and the house margarita is described as 'more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.'

The language intensity is moderate, using words like 'great!' for the food but 'kinda ick' for the drink, and 'deceiving' for the guac. There are no extreme superlatives for the overall experience nor particularly harsh condemnations.

Recommendation likelihood is low and conditional: 'I might try it again if I could do it on a weeknight,' indicating a reluctance to revisit under similar circumstances (busy Saturday night). The concluding statement 'for now it just gets my average' firmly places the experience in the neutral, 3-star range, despite the high points of one dish. The balance of a positive dish/menu concept against significant operational and service failures, coupled with a disappointing drink and guac, aligns perfectly with an 'average/mixed experience.'","```json

"Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?",3,2,"This review presents a classic mixed experience, starting with a strong positive, but quickly pivoting to a significant negative. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment is mixed. 'Great food' is strongly positive, while 'bad service' is strongly negative. The concluding rhetorical question, 'Does anyone speak english in here?', carries a tone of frustration, accusation, and exasperation, indicating a profoundly negative aspect of the service experience.

2.  **Language Intensity**: 'Great' is a strong positive adjective. 'Bad' is a strong negative adjective. The rhetorical question 'Does anyone speak english in here?' is highly intense, expressing a severe communication breakdown and potentially feeling alienated, which elevates the complaint beyond mere inconvenience.

3.  **Specific Feedback**: The review provides concrete feedback on two key areas: 'Great food' (quality) and 'bad service' (customer interaction). The follow-up question clarifies the 'bad service' as stemming from a perceived language barrier, making the complaint very specific and impactful regarding communication issues.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood**: Despite the 'Great food,' the severe service issues, particularly the communication barrier, make a strong recommendation highly unlikely. A customer facing such a fundamental communication problem would likely deter others who value clear interaction, even if they liked the food. The tone suggests frustration significant enough to deter a return visit for the reviewer themselves.

5.  **Complaint Severity**: 'Bad service' is a significant complaint. The specific mention of a language barrier ('Does anyone speak english in here?') elevates this to a very severe issue. A fundamental breakdown in communication can ruin an entire dining experience, leading to misunderstandings, frustration, and perceived disrespect. This is not a minor inconvenience but a core problem impacting the entire customer journey.

**Conclusion**: While the food received a high compliment, the service complaint is equally strong and, more importantly, *severe* due to the explicit mention of a perceived language barrier. This is a fundamental breakdown in the customer experience, often leading to deep dissatisfaction and an unwillingness to return, despite good food. The mixed nature leans heavily negative due to the impact of the service failure, making the overall experience below average and likely disappointing for the reviewer. Therefore, 2 stars best reflects a 'below average' experience dominated by significant negatives despite a positive aspect.","```json

"Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :) 

you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy... 

they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,, 

Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service... 

every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it... 

everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything... 

the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done... 

the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol 

over all 
The atmosphere was amazing..... 
the staff was fabulous... 
the food... eh... 
the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?! 
and its kinda on the pricey side... 

i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to... 
there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?",3,2,"This Yelp review presents a significantly mixed experience, with strong positives for ambiance and service, but critical negatives concerning the menu, value, and key food items. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of disappointment regarding the core dining experience (food and value), despite being highly impressed by the atmosphere and service. There's a clear sense of frustration and caution.
2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses strong superlatives for both positive and negative aspects. 'Amazing,' 'fabulous,' and 'so good' describe the atmosphere, staff, and one dish. However, equally intense language like 'crap' (menu), 'sucks' (menu structure), 'fiery hot' (spicy food), 'sadly disappointed,' 'gasping for water,' and 'health hazard' highlights severe dissatisfaction with other elements.
3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Parking/Location:** Positive (easy, ample options).
    *   **Atmosphere:** Highly positive (calming, low lighting, unique decor, relaxing).
    *   **Music/DJ:** Mixed (odd for reviewer's taste).
    *   **Service:** Highly positive (waitress 'very nice and helpful,' proactive, 'fabulous' staff overall).
    *   **Menu/Value:** Strongly negative (all appetizers, pricey, recommended 2-3 per person, leads to high cost, labeled 'crap').
    *   **Food Quality (Specifics):**
        *   Lemongrass Chicken: Very positive ('amazing!! so good').
        *   Gyoza: Neutral/Slightly negative (alright, 'too minty').
        *   Hot Stone Meat: Mixed (stone didn't stay hot enough for preferred doneness).
        *   Beef Wrapped in Grape Leaves: Severely negative (extremely spicy, not labeled, caused physical discomfort, reviewer perceived it as a 'health hazard').
4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Low. While the reviewer expresses a desire to 'try more dishes,' the concluding statement 'But I don't think I would opt to...' and 'maybe a different location would be better?' indicates a clear hesitation and reluctance to return to *this specific location*.
5.  **Complaint Severity:** High. The unlabeled, extremely spicy food causing physical discomfort and being labeled a 'health hazard' is a very serious complaint. The high price point for small portions and the general menu structure ('crap') are also significant issues that negatively impacted the overall experience.

**Conclusion:** While the ambiance and service were exemplary, the crucial aspects of food quality consistency, menu clarity (especially regarding spice levels), and perceived value were severely lacking and disappointing. The significant negative points, particularly the unlabeled spicy food and the overall cost, outweigh the positives, leading to a below-average experience and a strong hesitation to return.","```json

The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there.",3,5,"This Yelp review presents an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer initiates the review by affectionately referring to the store as 'My Basha's,' indicating a strong personal connection, loyalty, and high degree of satisfaction. Language intensity is generally positive and descriptive, using phrases like 'pretty extensive,' 'fresh,' 'quite a few organic choices,' and 'pleasant surprises.' The most notable positive is the 'always quick' checkout, which is highlighted as 'much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there,' providing a comparative and strong positive assessment of a key customer experience point.

Specific feedback is provided across multiple categories: extensive wine and beer selection, fresh produce with organic options, innovative natural foods section with new bulk dispensers. The only negative feedback is regarding 'mixed experiences getting help in the meat section.' This complaint is relatively minor in severity; it is not a consistent negative, but rather an inconsistent or 'mixed' one, suggesting occasional rather than constant issues. It does not overshadow the numerous and strong positive aspects mentioned.

Given the strong positive tone, the enthusiastic personal connection ('My Basha's'), the consistent excellence in multiple core areas (selection, quality, checkout speed), and the very minimal nature of the single complaint, the reviewer would undoubtedly recommend this store. The experience aligns closely with the 'Exceptional experience, highly enthusiastic, strong recommendation, minimal/no complaints' guideline for a 5-star rating, as the 'mixed experience' is truly a minimal complaint within the context of the overall glowing review.","```json

"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...",3,4,"This review presents a strong dichotomy. The reviewer uses highly intense positive language ('Excellent food', 'top-notch service') to describe the core dining experience elements. This indicates an exceptionally well-executed restaurant in terms of quality and service. However, the sentiment sharply shifts with 'exorbitantly priced' and 'Not for budget minded diners...', introducing a significant negative about value for money.

-   **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed. There is strong enthusiasm and satisfaction regarding the food and service, contrasted with clear disappointment and a warning regarding the pricing.
-   **Language Intensity:** The language is highly intense on both sides. 'Excellent' and 'top-notch' are superlatives indicating outstanding quality. 'Exorbitantly priced' is a very strong negative descriptor for cost, suggesting it's far beyond reasonable, and 'Not for budget minded diners...' is a direct and forceful advisory.
-   **Specific Feedback:** Concrete details include 'Excellent food' (quality), 'top-notch service' (staff performance), and 'exorbitantly priced' (cost/value). The atmosphere is not mentioned. The target audience is explicitly defined by what it's *not* for.
-   **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer offers a conditional recommendation. While the strong praise for food and service implies a recommendation for those who can afford it, the price point acts as a clear deterrent for 'budget minded diners'. It's a recommendation for a specific segment, and a warning for another.
-   **Complaint Severity:** The only complaint is about the price, but it is severe ('exorbitantly priced'). However, this complaint does not diminish the *quality* of the food or service, which are rated at the highest level. It's a severe complaint about value and accessibility, rather than a flaw in the product or service itself.

Despite the severe complaint about pricing, the unequivocally positive feedback on food and service, which are fundamental to a restaurant experience, elevates this review beyond an 'average/mixed' 3-star rating. The experience itself, apart from the cost, was exceptional. A 4-star rating acknowledges the outstanding quality of the product and service while giving significant weight to the serious pricing issue that would make it inaccessible or undesirable for a large segment of potential customers. It reflects a 'Very good experience' with a 'minor issue' in the context of universal appeal, or a 'major issue' for a specific budget, preventing a full 5-star 'Exceptional' rating due to the clear complaint.","```json

"You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. 

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!

I look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.",3,3,"The review presents a distinctly mixed experience, balancing strong praise for one item with significant criticisms for the overall atmosphere, cleanliness, and another food item. The reviewer starts with a powerful analogy of a 'fuzzy copy' to describe their general disappointment with the new location's execution compared to the original. This sets a tone of unmet expectations.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed, leaning towards disappointed and critical regarding the new location's ambiance, hygiene, and the Cuban sandwich, yet extremely enthusiastic and appreciative of the salad. There's a hopeful sentiment for improvement at the end.

**2. Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses vivid and intense language for both positive and negative points. Negatives include 'fuzzy around the edges,' 'not as sharp,' 'not as pulled together,' 'weird particle board chic tables,' 'every table was dirty,' 'blast furnace,' and 'grease dripping.' Positives are equally strong: 'best salad I've made to date,' 'patent your creations,' and 'so complete and delicious!' This strong contrasting language highlights the dichotomy of the experience.

**3. Specific Feedback:**
*   **Atmosphere:** Criticisms include a 'not as pulled together' vibe, lack of a lounging area, 'weird particle board chic tables,' *dirty tables everywhere*, 'grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill,' and an uncomfortably hot 'blast furnace' entrance.
*   **Service:** A minor but notable complaint of 'No forks?' indicates a lapse in basic table setting or attentiveness.
*   **Food Quality:** The salad is highly praised as 'probably the best salad I've made to date' and 'so complete and delicious!' The Cuban sandwich, however, is rated 'okay,' with issues like thick, chewy ciabatta rolls causing toppings to 'fire out the back,' and an 'Asian spice, like cardamom??' which was unexpected and disliked by 'The Mr.'
*   **Value:** Not explicitly mentioned.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Mixed and conditional. The reviewer states, 'I look forward to coming again,' but immediately qualifies this with, 'I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.' This is not an outright recommendation but a willingness to return *if significant improvements are made* to address the noted issues. It's a 'try again with reservations' stance.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints regarding 'every table was dirty' and 'grease dripping on the glass' are severe, indicating significant cleanliness and hygiene issues. The issues with the Cuban sandwich (taste, texture, unexpected spice) and lack of forks are moderate. The aesthetic preferences for the tables and lounging area are minor. The presence of major cleanliness issues prevents a higher rating despite the exceptional salad.","```json

"clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.",3,4,"This review exhibits a predominantly positive sentiment with no complaints whatsoever, leading to a strong positive rating. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive. Phrases like 'clean store,' 'good parking,' and 'nice bonus' clearly indicate satisfaction. 'Decent prices' is moderately positive, suggesting acceptable value rather than exceptional, but still contributes to overall positivity.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is positive but generally moderate. Words like 'clean' and 'good' are strong positives but not extreme superlatives (e.g., 'amazing,' 'fantastic'). 'Decent' is a mild positive. The strongest positive phrasing is 'nice bonus,' which adds a touch of enthusiasm but doesn't elevate the entire experience to 'exceptional' levels.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The reviewer provides concrete details across multiple aspects: 'clean store' (atmosphere/cleanliness), 'good parking' (amenities/convenience), 'decent prices' (value/cost), and 'gas points savings is a nice bonus' (value/loyalty program benefit).

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Given the consistent positive feedback and absence of any complaints, the reviewer would very likely recommend this business to others or return themselves. The mention of 'gas points savings' highlights a specific benefit that could attract others.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are absolutely no complaints mentioned in the review.

**Conclusion:** The review describes a very solid and positive experience across multiple criteria (cleanliness, convenience, value). While there are no complaints, the language isn't overwhelmingly enthusiastic (e.g., 'decent prices' rather than 'fantastic prices') to warrant a full 5-star 'exceptional' rating for every aspect. However, the accumulation of multiple positives and the complete absence of negatives firmly place it in the 'very good experience' category, making 4 stars an appropriate prediction. It's a highly satisfactory experience, just short of 'exceptional' across the board.","```json

"They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.

Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.

Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.

My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.

The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.",3,3,"The review presents a distinctly mixed experience, balancing several positive observations with notable criticisms regarding the food. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is neutral-to-slightly-negative, marked by a mix of genuine appreciation and specific disappointments. There are no strong expressions of delight or anger, but rather a descriptive account of both good and bad aspects.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is moderate. Positives are described with words like 'proudly displayed,' 'I like that,' 'cooked perfectly,' and 'great.' Negatives, however, use phrases like 'a bit chewy,' 'suggest skipping on the beef balls,' and 'very bland,' which are strong enough to indicate significant dissatisfaction with specific dishes without being overly hyperbolic.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Atmosphere/Presentation:** Positive mention of 'high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls.'
    *   **Food Quality (Positive):** Chicken and tofu in the Pad Thai were 'cooked perfectly,' and 'Spring rolls were great.'
    *   **Food Quality (Negative):** Pad Thai noodles were 'a bit chewy.' The beef balls in the Thai noodle bowl were problematic, leading to a suggestion to 'skip' them. The Thai noodle bowl was also 'very bland' if ordered without spice.
    *   **Presentation Discrepancy:** Spring rolls were served whole instead of in halves, as pictured (a minor observation, not a complaint about quality).
    *   **Service/Owner Interaction:** The owner's recommendations for vacationing in Thailand and offers for granite flooring are unique and amusing observations, not direct feedback on the restaurant's core service quality, but indicative of a memorable, albeit quirky, interaction.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer does not explicitly state a recommendation to return or avoid. However, the strong advisories to 'skip' an item and the description of another as 'very bland' suggest a hesitance to recommend specific dishes and imply a less-than-enthusiastic overall endorsement. While some items were great, the significant issues with others would likely temper any positive recommendation.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The issues range from mild (chewy noodles, minor presentation discrepancy) to moderate-to-severe for specific items ('suggest skipping on the beef balls,' 'very bland if you order with no spice'). These are not minor issues that can be easily overlooked, as they pertain to the core quality and taste of main dishes.

**Conclusion:** The review clearly outlines a balanced experience. While elements like the interior decor and specific food components (chicken, tofu, spring rolls) were positive, critical flaws in other prominent dishes (chewy noodles, problematic beef balls, blandness) significantly detract from the overall impression. This balance of strong positives and significant negatives aligns perfectly with an 'Average/mixed experience, balanced positives and negatives, neutral stance,' warranting a 3-star rating.","```json

"Average airport. 

I wish gate Marques listed which zone was boarding. There were three airplanes loading at the same time and it was near impossible to tell which gate was loading which zone. We just waited a few minutes and rolled the dice that our zone was loading.",3,2,"The reviewer begins by stating 'Average airport,' which suggests a neutral overall sentiment. However, the entirety of the specific feedback provided is negative, detailing a significant operational inconvenience. The core complaint revolves around the lack of clear boarding zone information ('gate Marques' – likely referring to gate signage/announcements) when multiple airplanes were loading simultaneously. Phrases like 'near impossible to tell' and 'rolled the dice' convey a sense of frustration, confusion, and inefficiency. The language intensity is moderate; while not using extreme superlatives, 'near impossible' indicates a high level of difficulty. The specific feedback is concrete, pointing to a functional deficiency in the airport's boarding process. There are no positive details mentioned to balance this negative experience. The complaint severity is moderate; it caused inconvenience and uncertainty for the traveler, directly impacting their boarding experience, but not leading to a catastrophic outcome like missing a flight. Given that the detailed account focuses solely on a frustrating, below-average operational experience, despite the initial 'average' descriptor, the sentiment leans towards disappointment rather than neutrality or positivity.

"Good food, but very expensive for a simple breakfast joint ($8-10 for most breakfast items). Also, the menu has very few healthy options...which isn't a problem for me, but is for my wife!  How about putting an egg white omelet on the menu?

Seems to be family owned and does have a good atmosphere. But at these prices, I wonder how long it will be around. There were lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning, which has to be the bread and butter of a place like this.",3,2,"The dominant emotional tone is one of significant disappointment and concern, despite an initial acknowledgment of positive aspects. The reviewer starts with 'Good food' and mentions a 'good atmosphere' and 'family owned,' but these positives are immediately and heavily overshadowed by strong negatives. The language intensity is notable, using phrases like 'very expensive,' 'very few healthy options,' and expressing deep concern about the restaurant's viability ('wonder how long it will be around,' 'lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning').

Specific feedback includes appreciation for food quality and atmosphere, but these are contrasted with critical points: the high price ($8-10 for simple breakfast) for what is perceived as a 'simple breakfast joint,' and the lack of healthy options (with a concrete suggestion for an egg white omelet). The most impactful specific feedback is the observation of numerous empty tables on a Sunday morning, which is presented as a serious indicator of business trouble for a breakfast establishment.

The reviewer does not explicitly state whether they would recommend the place. However, the pervasive negative sentiment regarding value, menu options, and especially the deep skepticism about the restaurant's long-term survival due to lack of customers on a peak day, strongly implies that they would be unlikely to recommend it or return. The complaint severity is high, with the primary issue being the 'very expensive' pricing leading to poor value perception, and the highly concerning observation about empty tables on a Sunday morning, which casts a dark shadow on the business's future. This combination of significant financial criticism and a dire outlook on the business's viability pushes the review well into the 'below average' category, indicating disappointment and an unlikely return.","```json

We even went for their three plate combo for $40.00 / person, and the cupcake it came with, I only took 1 bite.  I didn't even see the chocolate explosion on the menu... very disappointing.  It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed...  and that hasn't happened.",3,2,"This review expresses significant disappointment, particularly regarding value for money. The dominant emotional tone is one of being underwhelmed and let down, especially given the high price point. The language intensity is moderate to high, with phrases like 'Unfortunately...', 'just ok' (when expectations are high), 'not $140.00 great', 'only took 1 bite' for a dessert, and 'very disappointing'. The reviewer directly states 'you really want to be wowed... and that hasn't happened', indicating unmet expectations.

Specific feedback highlights food quality ('food was just ok', specific negative feedback on a 'cupcake it came with, I only took 1 bite'), and most critically, poor value ('not $140.00 great', 'it would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00').

The recommendation likelihood is very low. While they hypothetically state 'it would be good, if it was cheaper', this is not a current endorsement. The overall sentiment is that at its current price, it's not worth it. The complaint severity is high because it directly impacts the core offering (food) and its value proposition, and the disappointment is explicitly linked to the significant cost.

Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. That's what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.,3,2,"This review exhibits a dominant sentiment of disappointment due to unmet high expectations, explicitly stating, 'That's what happened with St. Francis anyways.'

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The overall sentiment is one of disappointment and mild frustration, stemming from a significant service failure (unfriendly bartender). This is partially mitigated by a positive comment about the dessert and a hopeful, forgiving tone regarding future visits ('sometimes you just catch people on an off night'). However, the initial letdown from high expectations and the core service complaint weigh heavily.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses moderately intense language. 'Very high expectations' sets a strong initial context. 'Not friendly at all' is a definitive and strong negative descriptor for the service. 'Very good' is a positive but not overly enthusiastic descriptor for the dessert. The concluding remarks ('hopefully next time... off night') soften the overall intensity, suggesting a willingness to give the restaurant another chance, but they do not negate the negative experience of this visit.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** Concrete details are provided for both negatives and positives:
    *   **Service:** The bartender was 'not friendly at all' (Negative).
    *   **Food:** The dessert was 'very good' (Positive).
    *   **Expectations:** Explicitly states high expectations were not met, influenced by other Yelp reviews (Contextual Negative).
    *   **Atmosphere/Value:** Not mentioned.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer does not offer a recommendation. While they express a conditional hope for future improvement ('Hopefully next time the service will be better'), this indicates a reluctance to recommend based on *this* experience and only a possibility of returning, rather than a strong intention. They are certainly not enthusiastic.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaint about the bartender being 'not friendly at all' is significant, as service is a core component of the dining experience. While the 'off night' comment attempts to explain it away, it doesn't lessen the impact of the actual negative interaction. The initial disappointment from unmet expectations also contributes to the overall severity of the below-average experience. The positive feedback on a single dessert item, while good, doesn't fully balance the fundamental service issue and the overall feeling of unmet expectations for the visit.

**Conclusion:** Despite a good dessert and a forgiving tone, the review clearly communicates disappointment and a significant service issue. The explicitly stated unmet high expectations, coupled with a strong negative service interaction, suggest an overall experience that fell below average for this visit. The reviewer is not warning others away, but is also far from recommending it. This aligns well with a 2-star rating, indicating a disappointed, below-average experience with more negatives than positives for the specific visit.","```json

The reviewer explicitly states they 'had to think twice' and admits their prior review was 'a bit douchy.' The dominant emotional tone is one of reconsideration and positive affirmation.

Language intensity is quite strong in its positive assertions and self-correction, using phrases like 'definitely a great spot' and 'the way to go' for the spicy chicken bowl, coupled with a direct dismissal of their past negative review ('Don't listen to my old review').

Specific feedback includes the place being ideal for a 'quick lunch' and 'on the go,' being a 'fairly comfortable place to eat,' and a 'better for you' option. The 'spicy chicken bowl' is highlighted as a specific, highly recommended food item. The only concrete detail that could be construed as negative is about the 'watered down Sriracha.'

"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.

I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.

Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.",3,3,"This review presents a highly mixed sentiment, struggling between a strong initial negative bias and a surprising acknowledgment of positive aspects. The reviewer starts with extreme negative framing ('Boo!' repeated, 'least favorite carriers', 'least favorite airport', 'recipe for disaster') but consistently finds redeeming qualities for Southwest Airlines specifically at Sky Harbor.

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of grudging acceptance, bordering on surprisingly positive given the reviewer's low expectations and general dislike. While there's clear frustration with travel generally and Southwest specifically, the core message becomes 'you can do worse' and that 'somehow it works out' in Southwest's benefit. The final sentence, 'every once in a while it's a painless operation,' further solidifies this mixed, yet ultimately tolerable, experience.

**Language Intensity:** The language uses several superlatives and extreme words, both negative ('least favorite', 'recipe for disaster', 'edge of the universe') and positive ('genius' for bags fly free). The repeated 'Boo!' indicates strong, visceral dislike, but these are offset by phrases like 'you can do worse' and 'painless operation.'

**Specific Feedback:** Concrete details include the 'bags fly free thing is genius' (strong positive on value/policy). On airport integration, Southwest is noted for not 'banish[ing]' travelers to inconvenient locations for check-in/baggage claim and having a 'decent presence' to find human help (positive on service/convenience). Negative specifics include being 'stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather' and being 'force[d] to dash across the airport with late arriving flights' (negative on reliability/comfort).

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would reluctantly recommend Southwest, or at least not strongly dis-recommend it, stating explicitly 'you can do worse than Southwest.' This is not an enthusiastic endorsement but rather a pragmatic acceptance, suggesting it's a viable option when one 'has to travel.'

**Complaint Severity:** The complaints about being stranded or forced to rush are severe operational issues. However, the reviewer tempers these with 'may leave you stranded' and 'force you to dash' (implying possibility rather than certainty for every trip), and ultimately concludes with the balancing statement that 'every once in a while it's a painless operation.' This framing reduces the overall severity to a level of occasional inconvenience rather than consistent disaster.

**Conclusion:** Despite a very negative setup, the review balances significant criticisms with notable praises (bags fly free, airport convenience, staff presence, 'you can do worse'). The overall experience described is mixed, occasionally problematic, but surprisingly acceptable given the reviewer's initial low opinion. This aligns perfectly with a 3-star rating: 'Average/mixed experience, balanced positives and negatives, neutral stance' regarding a pragmatic choice despite personal preference.","```json

  ""explanation"": ""This review presents a highly mixed sentiment, struggling between a strong initial negative bias and a surprising acknowledgment of positive aspects. The reviewer starts with extreme negative framing ('Boo!' repeated, 'least favorite carriers', 'least favorite airport', 'recipe for disaster') but consistently finds redeeming qualities for Southwest Airlines specifically at Sky Harbor.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of grudging acceptance, bordering on surprisingly positive given the reviewer's low expectations and general dislike. While there's clear frustration with travel generally and Southwest specifically, the core message becomes 'you can do worse' and that 'somehow it works out' in Southwest's benefit. The final sentence, 'every once in a while it's a painless operation,' further solidifies this mixed, yet ultimately tolerable, experience.\n\n**Language Intensity:** The language uses several superlatives and extreme words, both negative ('least favorite', 'recipe for disaster', 'edge of the universe') and positive ('genius' for bags fly free). The repeated 'Boo!' indicates strong, visceral dislike, but these are offset by phrases like 'you can do worse' and 'painless operation.'\n\n**Specific Feedback:** Concrete details include the 'bags fly free thing is genius' (strong positive on value/policy).

"Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too.

The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?",3,4,"This review presents a clear dichotomy between exceptional food and a highly undesirable location. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The sentiment regarding food is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, using words like 'favorite,' 'perfect,' and 'really good.' Conversely, the sentiment towards the location and its surroundings is strongly negative, expressed as 'kind of sucks' and listing undesirable neighbors.

**2. Language Intensity:** There is high intensity for positives ('favorite,' 'perfect,' 'really good'). For negatives, 'kind of sucks' is a moderately strong negative, amplified by the concluding 'Need I say more?' which implies the surroundings are self-evidently poor and unpleasant.

**3. Specific Feedback:** 
*   **Food Quality:** Excellent and exceptional. The jalapeno cheese burger is described as 'perfect,' and the fries are 'really good.' This is the reviewer's 'favorite Lenny's location' specifically for food. 
*   **Service:** Not mentioned.
*   **Atmosphere/Location:** Extremely negative regarding the external environment, citing a greyhound station, liquor store, and AA hall as neighbors, leading to the overall assessment that the 'location kind of sucks.'
*   **Value:** Not mentioned.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Highly likely to recommend for the food. Despite the significant complaints about the location, the declaration 'Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location' indicates a strong willingness to return and a high recommendation specifically for the culinary experience, suggesting the food quality outweighs the external drawbacks for this reviewer.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaint about the location is severe. It's not a minor issue but describes an undesirable external environment that could significantly detract from the overall experience for many. However, the reviewer's strong positive endorsement of the food indicates they personally overcome or tolerate this severe complaint due to the food's excellence.

**Overall Justification:** The review highlights an exceptional food experience, explicitly stating it's the reviewer's 'favorite' for food among all locations. This level of praise for the core product (food) is a major driver for a high star rating. While the location is described in very negative terms, it does not seem to deter the reviewer from considering it their top choice for food. The severe complaint about the location prevents a perfect 5-star rating (which suggests minimal/no complaints), but the overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic feedback on the food, indicating a strong likelihood of return, places it firmly in the 4-star category for a 'very good experience' where significant issues are present but outweighed by compelling positives.","```json

"I created a monster when I brought my family to Chipotle for the first time many years ago. I am constantly taking one for ""the team"" when I am dragged here by my wife and one of my sons. 

I usually get the carnitas tacos with the salsa that has the little tomatoes, onions and cilantro. I even pony up an extra $1.80 for the guacamole. I just wish there was the option of adding tomatoes to your taco without the onions and cilantro. How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?",3,3,"This review presents a mixed, somewhat humorous perspective, leading to a 3-star (average/mixed) rating. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of playful resignation and begrudging acceptance. Phrases like 'created a monster,' 'constantly taking one for ""the team,"" ' and 'dragged here' suggest the reviewer is not personally enthusiastic about visiting Chipotle. However, the 'monster' refers to his family's love for the restaurant, implying that Chipotle is successful in satisfying others. There's no genuine anger or severe disappointment, but rather a personal preference against frequent visits.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language is moderately intense but used for comedic effect rather than expressing strong negative emotion. 'Monster,' 'constantly taking one for the team,' and 'dragged' are exaggerations that convey a humorous, long-suffering spouse/parent persona, not a genuinely terrible experience. No extreme negative superlatives are used to describe the food or service.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The reviewer provides concrete details about their order: carnitas tacos, 'the salsa that has the little tomatoes, onions and cilantro,' and paying an 'extra $1.80 for the guacamole.' This shows a consistent order and an understanding of the menu. The primary specific feedback is a 'wish' for the option to add tomatoes without onions and cilantro, which is a very specific customization preference. There is no feedback regarding service, atmosphere, or overall food quality beyond this specific condiment issue.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer doesn't explicitly recommend or warn against Chipotle. However, the fact that they are 'constantly taking one for ""the team""' and are 'dragged here by my wife and one of my sons' indicates that their family *does* recommend it and enjoys it. The reviewer themselves continues to go and order specific items, suggesting an underlying acceptance despite their personal reluctance.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The sole complaint is extremely low in severity. It's a personal preference about a minor customization detail (tomatoes without other pico de gallo components). This is not a complaint about food quality, freshness, incorrect order, poor service, cleanliness, or value, all of which would be more severe. The rhetorical question, 'How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?' highlights a personal culinary preference rather than a defect in the restaurant's offering.

Overall, while the reviewer personally expresses a lack of enthusiasm for repeat visits, their actions (ordering specific items, paying extra for guacamole) and the very minor nature of their only complaint prevent this from being a negative review. The family's enjoyment balances the reviewer's personal ambivalence, aligning with an 'average/mixed experience' score.","```json

"Loved the location at atmosphere of this place!  Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and I'd recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!  

We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone!

The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.

We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before we've finished dessert.  Both of these happened here.",4,4,"The review exhibits a predominantly positive sentiment, with strong enthusiasm for various aspects of the establishment. The language intensity is high on the positive side, using words like 'Loved,' 'gorgeous,' 'great,' 'delicious,' 'tender, flaky,' and 'nice complement.' This indicates a highly satisfactory experience regarding location, atmosphere (especially al fresco dining, which is explicitly recommended 'to anyone'), bar selection ('nice wine by the glass list,' 'nice stocked bar,' 'Something for everyone!'), and food quality. The reviewer provides specific, concrete details for all these points, praising the Hapuku fish with descriptive terms. The only area of complaint is service timing, specifically plate clearing and bill delivery. While these issues are clearly stated and bothered the reviewer ('not well-timed'), the service itself is still described as 'very polite.' The complaint severity is low-to-moderate; these are minor operational/etiquette issues rather than fundamental flaws in food, staff demeanor, or overall experience. The explicit recommendation for outdoor dining strongly suggests a high likelihood of the reviewer returning or recommending it to others despite the minor timing hiccups. Given the overwhelming positives in atmosphere, food, drinks, and polite service, with only minor, non-critical complaints, a 4-star rating ('Very good experience, mostly positive, minor issues mentioned, would likely return') is most appropriate.","```json

"I'm not sure how I've missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I can't believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit!

It was packed on the New Year's Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. I'm knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within.",4,4,"This review exhibits a predominantly positive sentiment, despite a minor complaint. The reviewer expresses regret for not discovering the establishment sooner, highlighting it as a superior alternative to their past choice (IHOP), particularly for 'hang-over recovery'.

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and somewhat regretful (for not trying it sooner), with a touch of enthusiasm. Phrases like 'Dammit!', 'can't believe I relied exclusively', 'very good', and 'friendly and professional' convey a strong, positive lean.

**Language Intensity:** The language uses moderate to high intensity. 'Dammit!' is an exclamation of regret. 'Jam-packed' describes the atmosphere vividly. 'Calorie-laden' is descriptive. 'Very good' and 'friendly and professional' are strong positive descriptors.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Food:** Ordered a 'calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs'. The 'chicken pieces were too dry for my taste' (negative specific). 'But the rest of the skillet was very good' (positive specific). No other food items were detailed.
*   **Service:** Described as 'a bit slow' but immediately qualified as 'on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day', effectively neutralizing this minor point. Later described as 'friendly and professional' (positive specific).
*   **Atmosphere:** 'Packed on the New Year's Day morning'. Implied as a 'popular breakfast joint' and noted 'lots of ASU students within'.
*   **Value/Experience:** Implied as a better choice than IHOP for a specific need.

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer would very likely recommend this place. The opening paragraphs clearly indicate a strong preference for this place over their previous go-to. The 'Wildcats beware' comment is a playful warning, not a serious deterrent.

**Complaint Severity:** The main complaint, 'the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste', is relatively mild. It's a specific texture issue for one component of a dish, and the reviewer explicitly states 'the rest of the skillet was very good'. This issue led to 'knocking off a star', aligning it perfectly with a 4-star rating where minor issues are present but the overall experience is very good.","```json

"There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR. 

Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. 

Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. 

If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.

It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.

WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:
Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!

Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!",4,5,"The dominant sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive and highly enthusiastic, particularly concerning the food and the value offered by Happy Hour. The reviewer uses strong superlatives and emotional language throughout, such as 'glorious words' for Happy Hour, 'unbelievable apple chutney,' 'hearty and huge' lamb stew, 'soft and delicious' veggie burger, and 'fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges' that induce 'cravings'. The explicit statement 'Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!' at the end is a clear indicator of exceptional satisfaction with the core offering.

Specific feedback is abundant, detailing dishes like the brie, lamb stew, shepherd's pie, and a vegetarian 'thingy' with 'tator wedges, along with mentions of Happy Hour discounts and flavored Guinness options. The reviewer provides actionable recommendations for specific dishes and tips for enjoying the atmosphere ('get there early,' 'leave your ridiculously high heels at home').

While there are some complaints regarding a desired larger beer selection, noise/crowding at night leading to potential standing, and a lack of additional amenities like darts, these are presented as suggestions for improvement rather than severe detractors that ruined the experience. The reviewer frames them as 'If I could change one thing' or 'I wish they offered more,' rather than fundamental flaws. The overall tone accepts these minor inconveniences, especially given the positive attributes.

The recommendation likelihood is very high, with the reviewer actively encouraging readers to 'try the brie,' 'opt for the lamb stew,' and 'Try their veggie burger thingy.'

"Want a unique date night?  Craving for something to do on your own?  Want to have an avenue to express your inner artistic abilities?  OK, here you go!

Very interesting concept: Pick a piece of pottery, think of what you would like to design on it, you can draw your idea on with pencil, go grab your paints, brush, sponges, or stencils, and away you go.  They will then fire & glaze it, ready to pick up your masterpeice in a few days,

A great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.

1 star lost for the very annoying and extremely intrusive studio ""helper"" which I will leave un-named.  Kinda ruined alot of the experience.  I should say that if you need assistance, you can have it, but when you do NOT need it, well, please leave us alone - ie: i f you are in Barnes & Noble, you don't need a clerk to repeatedly come up to you every 10 mins to ask if you are going to buy that book or they read it, or do you want a better suggestion..... ect.",4,4,"The review presents a predominantly positive sentiment towards the pottery studio's core concept and atmosphere, but it is significantly tempered by a severe service complaint. The reviewer uses highly enthusiastic and positive language to describe the experience, such as 'unique date night,' 'inner artistic abilities,' 'Very interesting concept,' and 'A great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.' These descriptions, coupled with the detailed explanation of the creative process and the potential for 'masterpiece' creation, strongly suggest an initial 5-star potential.

However, the reviewer explicitly states '1 star lost' due to a 'very annoying and extremely intrusive studio ""helper""' who 'Kinda ruined a lot of the experience.' This complaint is highly specific, using intense negative language and a vivid analogy (Barnes & Noble clerk) to underscore the severity and intrusiveness of the unsolicited assistance. While the complaint is potent, it focuses on a single aspect of the service rather than the overall concept, quality of materials, or facility.

The recommendation likelihood is strong for the *concept* and *activity*, as the reviewer praises its benefits for stress relief, creative expression, and creating unique items. However, this recommendation comes with a clear and strong caveat regarding unwanted staff interaction. The complaint severity is high enough to detract significantly from the overall experience but not so widespread as to negate all the positives.

Given the explicit '1 star lost' from an implied 5-star baseline (due to the extensive positive framing) and the fact that the core offering remains highly praised despite the service hiccup, a 4-star rating is appropriate.

Good food and freindly staff. They have a nice selection on the menu. After seeing the table next to me I wish I'd of had the house specialty....blueberry pancakes. Next time........,4,5,"This review conveys an overwhelmingly positive experience with no complaints and a clear intention to return. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and anticipatory. Phrases like ""Good food,"" ""friendly staff,"" and ""nice selection"" are all positive. The ""wish I'd had the house specialty... Next time........"" indicates a desire for a future visit to try something new, rather than regret about the current meal, making it an anticipatory positive.
2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate, using positive but not extreme superlatives (""Good,"" ""friendly,"" ""nice""). However, the complete absence of any negative feedback, combined with the strong forward-looking statement, gives the review significant positive weight.
3.  **Specific Feedback:** Concrete positive details are provided regarding food quality (""Good food""), service (""friendly staff""), and menu variety (""nice selection""). The mention of the ""blueberry pancakes"" as a house specialty observed at another table adds a specific, enticing detail for future visits.
4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Very high. The explicit statement ""Next time........"" is a strong indicator of the reviewer's intent to return, essentially serving as an indirect but powerful recommendation.
5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are no complaints whatsoever. The 'wish' regarding the blueberry pancakes is a personal observation and a reason to return, not a critique of the dining experience itself. 

Overall, the review points to an exceptional experience with no issues, strong positive feedback, and a clear desire for a return visit, aligning perfectly with a 5-star rating.","```json

"Food is great, but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore. I love their prime rib burger, if you have a few extra bucks to spend on the best burger in the world than go here.",4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive despite a minor complaint. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is highly enthusiastic and positive. Phrases like ""Food is great,"" ""I love their prime rib burger,"" and ""best burger in the world"" convey strong approval and excitement. There is a single note of disappointment regarding a policy change (""but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore""), but this is overshadowed by the positive aspects.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer strongly recommends the restaurant, directly stating, ""than go here,"" particularly if one is willing to spend a bit more for the burger.
5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaint about the happy hour takeout policy change is very mild. It's a point of disappointment over a lost perk rather than an issue with the current quality of food, service, or overall experience. It does not detract significantly from the reviewer's overall satisfaction and high recommendation.

**Conclusion:** The effusive praise for the food, particularly the prime rib burger being the ""best in the world,"" and the strong recommendation far outweigh the very minor policy complaint. This indicates an exceptional experience, aligning perfectly with a 5-star rating.","```json

Place - Small.
Food - Fantastic.
Wait - Usually.
Bathroom - An adventure.

We didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.

"Cevapi and Burek oh my!! Plus I got to hang with my fabulous friend Amra! Score! We wanted something extra good to eat after finishing our Mud Factor race on Saturday and lord knows I have been craving some Cevapi so off we went to Euro Bakery. It was already bookmarked as a place I wanted to try so this was a win, win in my book. 

Everything is made fresh to order and once you walk in, you can smell the fresh baked bread that they have made throughout the day. There is also a mini grocery store for you to buy items as well.  My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.

That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho.",4,5,"The reviewer's overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and highly enthusiastic. Despite being a first-time pho eater and initially comparing the dish to 'glorified Ramen Noodles,' they explicitly state the restaurant's pho 'was good,' though 'not great.' However, the feedback for other items is exceptionally positive: the spring roll was 'amazing,' the crab was 'great,' and the fresh coconut juice was 'delightful.' The only minor negative was the 'egg roll,' which was not liked 'as much as I thought I would,' but even then, its freshness was noted positively.

Language intensity is notably high for positive aspects, using superlatives such as 'amazing,' 'great,' and 'delightful.' The sentiment regarding the restaurant's specific pho is mild-to-moderate positive, but the sentiment for other dishes and the overall experience is strongly positive. There are no severe complaints; the mild reservations about the pho are largely qualified by the reviewer's newness to the dish itself, and the egg roll issue is a matter of personal preference rather than a quality flaw.

The recommendation likelihood is very high, with the reviewer stating, 'I would go back again for sure.' This strong intent to return, coupled with the numerous high-praise points for various menu items, indicates an exceptional experience despite a nuanced take on one specific dish. The review aligns perfectly with a 5-star rating, reflecting a highly enthusiastic endorsement and minimal, non-critical issues.","```json

"The Paseo Trail travels through Chandler along the Consolidated Canal.  It runs mostly N-S, connecting to other trails along the canal in Mesa and Gilbert, totaling around 18 miles.

The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians.

There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll.

One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.  Most are not marked for motorists as trail crossings and there is no crosswalk so you may be faced with a relatively long wait to get a break in traffic or forcing the issue and forging ahead with care.",4,4,"The review demonstrates a highly objective, informative, and practical sentiment. The language intensity is low, devoid of superlatives or extreme words, focusing instead on factual descriptions and practical advice. The reviewer provides a wealth of specific feedback, detailing the trail's length, connections, surface types (paved vs. pea gravel), gentle grade, diverse scenery (subdivisions, golf courses, farms), and comprehensive parking options with specific recommendations for starting points and route strategy. The recommendation likelihood is high, implicitly conveyed by the detailed, helpful information intended to guide potential users, rather than dissuade them. The only complaint mentioned regarding major street crossings lacking markings or crosswalks is presented as a practical issue requiring patience or caution, not a severe safety hazard or an experience-ruining flaw.

"I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one! A semblance of a normal crowd. We ended up talking with some weirdo local chick, thought they were trying to do some kind of bizarre swinger plot, and they kicked rocks. Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing. Maybe it was because I was inebriated, but the Karaoke was outstanding. These two chicks really belted it out last night. I had a really good time drinking here with my friend. They sell Heineken 22 oz bottles here. I thought that was pretty cool.

I love the 80's soundtrack, my only complaint is that it was a bit too loud at night, so you had to scream to talk. The food is very good, kind of a modern take on comfort food.

"Good food, decent price and a southwestern atmosphere. 

The food is decidedly better than the decor, but then again I've never been big on the southwestern look. Something about Antlers above my head while I'm trying to have a romantic night out with the lady just doesn't cut it for me.

"I tried El Pollo Supremo based on a recommendation from my professor. I always though he was a smart man, but after eating here I know it. 

For under $5 you get chicken  that is juicy and flavorful and a plateful of tasty sides and condiments. Wrap it all up in one of the piping hot tortillas that comes with your meal and enjoy.

"In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus. 

After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste. 

Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. 

and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.

Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their ""famous"" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one! 

To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didn't work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! It's gonna be a blast!!",4,4,"This review exhibits a predominantly enthusiastic and positive sentiment, despite detailing several specific criticisms. The reviewer uses highly intensive language and superlatives throughout, such as calling the restaurant a 'foodie mecca,' an experience leading to 'foodie nirvana,' and describing dishes as 'overwhelmingly awesome' and 'worth going bananas over.' This strong positive framing sets a high bar.

Specific feedback is abundant:
-   **Atmosphere:** Highly praised for 'plush and lux furnishings,' 'amazing location,' and 'trendy lil touches,' with a minor complaint about non-working outdoor heaters.
-   **Food:** Stellar praise for the Pretzel and cheese fondue, Shrimp Po' Boy (Musketeer #1's dish), and especially the 'famous' Monkey Bread. However, the Truffle Egg Scramble (Musketeer #2's dish) was deemed 'not bad... but not terrific' and 'just missed something,' being the 'low point.' The reviewer's own Coq a Vin was 'very good' but had an 'odd texture' and 'could have used a few more hours in the oven,' suggesting it was 'done... but barely.'
-   **Service:** A clear negative note was made about a 'cooler-than-thou waiter' who was difficult to find when needed for bread and butter, leading to a 'VERY long time' wait.
-   **Value:** The cost ('lil over a hundred clams' for three) and time commitment ('a few hours') are mentioned not as complaints, but as conditions for enjoying this 'foodie nirvana' experience.

The recommendation likelihood is very high, albeit conditional. The reviewer explicitly states, 'if you have the cash to spend... a few hours... and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana... then this is the spot for you!' The closing 'It's gonna be a blast!!' reinforces this.

While complaints are present (a middling dish, a slightly undercooked dish, slow/aloof service, non-functioning heaters), their severity is moderate rather than extreme. They do not detract from the overall 'very good experience' and enthusiastic recommendation for the target audience. The overwhelming positive language and strong recommendation outweigh these specific issues, preventing a drop to 3 stars, but the complaints are significant enough to warrant a deduction from a perfect 5-star rating.","```json

"I have used The Parking Spot twice now, and am a registered card carrying member...lol. I have coworkers who use one of the other economy places across the street, but they don't get covered parking and I don't remember them being offered a complimentary news paper on entry and nice cool water when leaving. I get a government discount with ID and you can usually find a coupon online. Not to mention the prompt pick up. They are behind my vehicle ready for me and my luggage even before I am out of my car. There have been times when we wait for a few more people before we go to the airport, but never more than 10 or so min. I love not having to weave my way through the airport construction or get lost or delayed trying to park at the airport. 
When getting picked up the most I have had to wait was about 20 min. And as I was about ready to call, they showed up. Don't loose your ticket. I have seen others who have and it makes it really tough. You can pretty much expect to be the drivers last drop off, unless you remember where it is or see your car as others are getting dropped off. 

The entrance is just W. of 40th St. and can only be accessed when heading W. bound on Washington due to the light rail. But the website has some good directions as well.",4,5,"The reviewer expresses an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment for The Parking Spot. They are a repeat customer ('card carrying member') who clearly prefers this service over competitors.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is highly positive and enthusiastic. The reviewer frequently highlights benefits and expresses satisfaction ('I love not having to weave'). While minor waits are mentioned, they are either quickly qualified as acceptable or resolved positively, preventing them from detracting significantly from the overall positive experience.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language indicates strong satisfaction without excessive use of extreme superlatives. Phrases like 'prompt pick up,' 'even before I am out of my car,' and 'I love not having to weave my way through' convey a high level of appreciation and a clear preference. The detailed positive comparisons with competitors also contribute to the strong positive intensity.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides abundant concrete details across several aspects. It praises: 
    *   **Amenities:** Covered parking, complimentary newspaper, cool water.
    *   **Value:** Government discount, online coupons.
    *   **Service (Departure):** Prompt pick-up at the vehicle, avoiding airport construction/hassle, reasonable shuttle wait times (never more than 10 min).
    *   **Service (Arrival):** Airport pick-up wait time (max 20 min, resolved before needing to call).
    *   **Logistics:** Directions to the lot, advice about tickets.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely high. The reviewer is a loyal, repeat customer who actively contrasts The Parking Spot's superior offerings with those of competitors. The detailed enumeration of benefits and the explicit expression of satisfaction ('I love') strongly indicate a recommendation.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints mentioned are minimal and very low in severity. The 10-minute wait for the shuttle at the lot is framed as acceptable ('never more than 10 or so min'). The 20-minute wait for airport pick-up is noted, but the reviewer adds, 'And as I was about ready to call, they showed up,' implying it was resolved just in time and did not become a significant issue. Other observations (losing tickets, being the last drop-off) are presented as helpful tips or realistic expectations rather than criticisms of the service itself. Overall, the issues are minor inconveniences rather than serious problems.","```json

It praises: \n    *   **Amenities:** Covered parking, complimentary newspaper, cool water.\n    *   **Value:** Government discount, online coupons.\n    *   **Service (Departure):** Prompt pick-up at the vehicle, avoiding airport construction/hassle, reasonable shuttle wait times (never more than 10 min).\n    *   **Service (Arrival):** Airport pick-up wait time (max 20 min, resolved before needing to call).\n    *   **Logistics:** Directions to the lot, advice about tickets.\n\n**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely high. The reviewer is a loyal, repeat customer who actively contrasts The Parking Spot's superior offerings with those of competitors. The detailed enumeration of benefits and the explicit expression of satisfaction ('I love') strongly indicate a recommendation.\n\n**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints mentioned are minimal and very low in severity. The 10-minute wait for the shuttle at the lot is framed as acceptable ('never more than 10 or so min'). The 20-minute wait for airport pick-up is noted, but the reviewer adds, 'And as I was about ready to call, they showed up,' implying it was resolved just in time and did not become a significant issue. Other observations (losing tickets, being the last drop-off) are presented as helpful tips or realistic expectations rather than criticisms of the service itself. Overall, the issues are minor inconveniences rather than serious problems.""

"I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If it's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. It's diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I won't shoot anyone! I'll get better.",4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic about the establishment. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is highly positive and appreciative. Phrases like 'really like this place!', 'very organized', 'willing to help you out', 'price is very acceptable', 'reasonable price', 'diffidently a great place', and 'workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way' all convey strong satisfaction and warmth.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is high, utilizing superlatives and strong positive affirmations ('really like', 'very organized', 'very acceptable', 'great place'). While there's self-deprecating humor ('dumb A$$ like myself', 'major brain freeze'), it doesn't diminish the positive view of the business.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details across several categories:
    *   **Atmosphere/Facility:** 'Plenty of room, very organized.'
    *   **Service:** 'willing to help you out', 'workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way.'
    *   **Value/Pricing:** 'Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day', 'ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price.'
    *   **First-timer experience:** Mentions a '10 min video they want you to watch', which is an informative, neutral point that implies safety/instruction.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly recommends the place with 'It's diffidently a great place to go.'

5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are no complaints directed at the business whatsoever. The 'complaints' mentioned ('dumb A$$ like myself', 'major brain freeze') are entirely self-deprecating humor and refer to the reviewer's own actions, not any failing of the establishment. In fact, the way the staff handled the reviewer's mistakes ('let me know what I did wrong in a polite way') is highlighted as a positive aspect of the service.

Based on the strong positive sentiment, explicit recommendation, detailed positive feedback on various aspects, and the complete absence of any complaints about the business itself, this review clearly indicates an exceptional experience, aligning perfectly with a 5-star rating.","```json

"Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepeño - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!

As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.",4,4,"The reviewer presents a largely enthusiastic and positive assessment of the venue, highlighting its strengths in music, food, beer, and exceptional value. Specific details like '$1 carne asada tacos' and 'lucious burgers' contribute to a strong positive sentiment. The 'Will definitely be back!' statement confirms a high likelihood of return and recommendation. However, the second paragraph introduces a significant concern regarding smoking in an outside venue, particularly from the perspective of a non-smoking asthmatic. While not explicitly stating a direct failure of the venue to enforce rules, the language expresses frustration with patron behavior and a general desire for adherence to regulations, which impacts the reviewer's personal comfort and 'non-polluters' experience. This complaint, though framed broadly, is a notable issue that prevents the experience from being 'minimal/no complaints' required for a perfect 5-star rating. It's an overwhelmingly positive experience with a significant, albeit general, environmental discomfort mentioned.","```json

"I'm giving 4 stars because I just love to find this many artifacts of the basket and clay varieties when I visit a museum. It really amazes me, the craftmanship of our ancient peoples! This small museum is not part of the Science Museum circuit, so I wasn't able to use my discount or member card, but for $6 I felt it was worth the trip to check it out. Some exhibits in the kids' room have been duplicated and enhanced in the main museum hall, which was fun to compare. The outdoor area is actually a preserved portion of a reservation belonging to the Hohokum Indians and there are examples of the water distribution canals and housing styles from 300 years ago along the Salt River, AZ. Great, informative afternoon!",4,4,"The reviewer explicitly rates the museum with 4 stars, and the analysis supports this classification.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. Phrases like 'love to find this many artifacts,' 'really amazes me,' 'felt it was worth the trip,' 'fun to compare,' and 'Great, informative afternoon!' all convey strong positive emotions, wonder, and satisfaction.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is quite intense and positive. Strong words such as 'love,' 'amazes me,' 'worth,' and the superlative 'Great' indicate a highly favorable experience.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides ample concrete details. Positive feedback highlights the abundance and quality of 'basket and clay varieties' artifacts, the 'craftsmanship of our ancient peoples,' the excellent value for the '$6' entry fee, the engaging exhibit design ('duplicated and enhanced' exhibits for comparison), and the specific details of the outdoor area (preserved Hohokum reservation with canals and housing styles). The overall experience is described as 'informative.'

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The strong positive sentiment and detailed positive descriptions, coupled with the explicit statement 'felt it was worth the trip to check it out,' indicate a high likelihood that the reviewer would recommend this museum to others.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The only 'issue' mentioned is the inability to use a 'discount or member card' due to the museum not being part of a specific circuit. However, this is immediately mitigated by the reviewer's declaration that 'for $6 I felt it was worth the trip.' This is a very minor inconvenience, an external factor, and does not detract from the core experience or value. It qualifies as a 'minor issue' as per the 4-star guideline, rather than a significant complaint.","```json

"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.",4,5,"The review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, marked by highly enthusiastic language and specific, vivid descriptions of the establishment's strengths. The reviewer begins by stating the place has 'absolutely nailed' its concept, immediately setting a strong positive tone.

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of enthusiastic approval and delight. The reviewer clearly enjoyed the experience, describing the atmosphere and food with excitement and humor.

**Language Intensity:** The language used is consistently intense and positive, featuring superlatives and strong descriptors. Examples include 'absolutely nailed,' 'spectacle,' 'genius stuff, really,' 'killer Sunday brunch buffet,' 'nothing like sitting out in the sun,' and 'tranquil as the doctor ordered.' This high intensity reinforces the exceptional nature of their experience.

**Specific Feedback:** The review is rich with concrete details across several categories:
*   **Atmosphere:** Described as a 'brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors,' with 'a few different bars,' 'games like the beanbag toss,' 'televised sporting events,' 'music blaring,' an 'Elvis room,' 'Chuck Norris jokes,' and 'drink specials' posters. The 'blue footprints' and 'dollar signs to the ATM' are highlighted as 'genius stuff.'
*   **Food & Value:** The 'killer Sunday brunch buffet' is praised, specifically mentioning 'all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff' for 'Ten bucks,' indicating excellent value.
*   **Experience:** The reviewer appreciates the 'feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz' aspect and notes the 'tranquil' Sunday morning vibe as 'just as the doctor ordered,' contrasting it with potential 'spring break wild' nights.

**Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely high. The effusive praise, lack of genuine complaints, and detailed positive accounts strongly indicate the reviewer would enthusiastically recommend Dos Gringos to others, especially for its unique atmosphere and Sunday brunch.

**Complaint Severity:** Extremely low. The only minor point of friction mentioned is arriving at 10:30 AM before the 11 AM opening. However, the reviewer immediately dismisses this as acceptable ('A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book'), effectively nullifying it as a complaint. This self-mitigation demonstrates that any minor inconvenience did not detract from the overall excellent experience.

"There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupe's: First off, you have to understand that it's not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, it's not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the ""waiter"", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the ""bus boys"". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is. 

Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I can't get enough of their enchilada's. If you're lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapilla's??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal.

The reviewer clearly outlines initial 'considerations' regarding food quality (not 'GREAT' in a gourmet sense, but 'grandma's house' style) and service (spotty, difficult to get check). However, these points are immediately followed by an explosion of enthusiasm for the food's taste, described with high intensity and superlatives like 'TAST-TEE!', 'amazing,' 'incredibly delicious,' and rhetorical questions expressing profound enjoyment ('WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?!'). The specific feedback on food (Poblano Chile and chicken mole enchiladas, sopapillas) is highly detailed and laudatory. While service complaints are moderately severe, the reviewer explicitly frames them as 'shortcomings' that can be 'looked past' for the overall experience. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, as the reviewer concludes that 'the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!' This strong, enthusiastic recommendation, coupled with the clear statement that the negatives are worth overlooking, points to an exceptional experience for the reviewer, aligning best with a 5-star rating, which can accommodate minor or acknowledged imperfections that don't detract from an otherwise outstanding visit.","```json

"So much food to choose from on the menu! They have so many options (healthy eater,unhealthy eater,  vegetarian, breakfast, lunch, etc)  for every kind of diner.

The only point that could be misconstrued as an unmet expectation regarding portion size is immediately resolved and reframed as a strong positive ('more than perfect'), thus elevating it beyond a complaint.""

"My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.",4,5,"The review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment. The reviewer declares the restaurant 'My new favorite Mexican place' and expresses 'Love' for their tacos, using strong language that indicates an exceptional experience. Specific feedback is plentiful and positive: food quality is highlighted with praise for tacos, generous portions ('chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself,' 'Portions are generous'), and a useful tip about mixing and matching items. Service is described as 'friendly and efficient,' making it convenient for a 'lunch hour' visit. The reviewer also identifies it as a 'great spot for happy hour,' further adding to its appeal. There are no actual complaints; the observation about 'small' shrimp is immediately qualified by 'but there are lots of 'em,' which actually reinforces the generosity. The reviewer explicitly and implicitly recommends the establishment for various occasions. The combination of strong positive language, detailed praise across multiple aspects, and the complete absence of negative feedback strongly aligns with a 5-star rating.","```json

"Shame on me for not writing a review sooner.  Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about 2 months prior as well.  We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. 

As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. 

We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. 

I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.",4,5,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, expressing highly enthusiastic sentiment from the opening apology for late review to the strong closing recommendations. The language intensity is high, using superlatives and strong positive descriptors such as 'packed,' 'flowing,' 'bustling,' 'huge highlight,' 'delicious,' 'lots of flavor,' 'fun,' 'definitely go back,' and 'must visit.'

Specific feedback is rich and detailed: it highlights the necessity for advance reservations (2 months prior), the vibrant and bustling atmosphere, the unique draw of celebrity sightings (Muhammed Ali, Brewers Manager) which contributes to its 'sporting atmosphere,' and the convenience of being 'walkable from Downtown Scottsdale.' Food quality is explicitly praised, with the 10 oz ribeye described as 'delicious' and the mac and cheese having 'lots of flavor.'

The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, with the reviewer stating they would 'definitely go back here again next year' and calling it a 'must visit.' The only 'complaint' mentioned is an 'odd' suggestion from the waitress about approaching a celebrity diner. However, the reviewer frames this as their own respect for 'personal space' rather than a severe service issue or a flaw that detracted from their experience. The complaint severity is extremely low, almost negligible, and does not impact the overwhelmingly positive sentiment. This review clearly indicates an exceptional experience with minimal to no complaints, fully warranting a 5-star rating.","```json

Eorth a trip for pasta or their salads. Both are wonderful. And if you like garlic they know what you mean when you say xtra garlic. They actually give you extra. Yummm. Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night.,4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, indicating an exceptional experience. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is highly positive and satisfied, bordering on delighted. Phrases like 'Eorth a trip', 'wonderful', 'Yummm', and the satisfaction of receiving 'xtra garlic' clearly convey strong enjoyment. Even the humorous concluding remark ('Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night') is a lighthearted testament to the generous, enjoyable amount of garlic, not a complaint.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is quite intense and uses superlatives effectively. 'Wonderful' is a strong positive adjective. 'Eorth a trip' is a significant endorsement. 'Yummm' is an expressive, highly positive interjection. The emphasis on 'they actually give you extra' highlights a pleasant surprise and met expectation, adding to the intensity.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete details about food quality, specifically mentioning 'pasta' and 'salads' as 'wonderful'. It also highlights the restaurant's attentiveness to customer requests by explicitly noting their ability to deliver 'xtra garlic' when asked. No specific feedback on atmosphere or value, but 'Eorth a trip' implicitly suggests good value.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly recommends the restaurant by stating 'Eorth a trip'. The overall enthusiastic tone and lack of negatives strongly suggest a high likelihood of recommendation to others.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are absolutely no complaints in this review. The final sentence is a humorous observation about a positive aspect (the quantity of garlic), not a detraction from the experience.","```json

"It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.  We each ordered a sandwich and a side salad for about $7.00 per person.  Everything was really very good.  I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.  I was too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets, but I will be sure to dive into that area on my next visit.",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, indicating an exceptional experience. The reviewer uses strong, enthusiastic language throughout, such as 'really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes,' 'Everything was really very good,' and the 'cuban sandwich... was so good, I had to finish it.'

Specific feedback highlights excellent food quality (Cuban sandwich, 'everything was really very good'), good value/portion size ('about $7.00 per person' for a sandwich and side salad, and being 'satisfied with only half' of the sandwich), and an appealing selection of sweets. 

The recommendation likelihood is extremely high; the reviewer explicitly states their intention to make it their 'standing Saturday lunch spot' due to their move into the neighborhood, a clear sign of strong endorsement and repeat business commitment. 

There are no complaints whatsoever. The only minor observation ('too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets') is framed positively, indicating satisfaction with the main meal and enthusiasm for future visits. This review aligns perfectly with an exceptional 5-star rating, demonstrating high enthusiasm and a strong recommendation without any noted issues.","```json

"Awesome Donuts! 

The only thing is, I was expecting the light fluffy glazed that Krispy Kreme has. This is not the same. HOWEVER these donuts are homemade delicious and why not support small businesses?!?! 

So why the 4/5 star instead of 5/5? Well the majority of our group LOVED the donuts and swears by them. HOWEVER, one or two just thought they were alright and preferred a light airy donut a la Krispy Kreme (lameeee). So thats why I am trying to represent all opinions here in my reviews.

We were headed there when they were closing the dining room apparently (the drive thru is 24 hours though), but the nice lady allowed us to come inside, we had a rather large group with us. 

THE BUTTERMILK donut is amazing!! TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!

These donuts taste fresh, delicious, and the customer service was so great when we were there that night. This place is the best donut place I have been to in AZ. No more KKreme or DDonuts (that place is not that good anyway). Just go to Bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again.",4,5,"This review, despite the reviewer's self-assigned 4/5 star, exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment and extremely strong recommendation, aligning it squarely with a 5-star rating based on the provided guidelines.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is highly enthusiastic and overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses phrases like 'Awesome Donuts!', 'homemade delicious', 'majority of our group LOVED the donuts and swears by them', 'THE BUTTERMILK donut is amazing!!', 'TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!', 'taste fresh, delicious', 'customer service was so great', and 'This place is the best donut place I have been to in AZ.' The concluding remarks, 'No more KKreme or DDonuts... Just go to Bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again,' are a testament to extreme satisfaction and brand loyalty.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language is highly intense, marked by frequent use of superlatives and extreme words. Examples include 'Awesome', 'amazing!!', 'TOTALLY worth', 'so great', 'best donut place I have been to in AZ', 'LOVED...swears by them', and a declaration to 'never go to a chain donut shop again.' Exclamation points are abundant, and capitalization ('HOWEVER', 'THE BUTTERMILK', 'TOTALLY') is used for strong emphasis, conveying deep enthusiasm.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Food Quality:** Explicitly praises 'homemade delicious' donuts, highlighting the 'BUTTERMILK donut' as 'amazing!!'. Notes they taste 'fresh, delicious'. While comparing them to Krispy Kreme's 'light fluffy glazed,' the reviewer clearly prefers Bosa's style and dismisses the KKreme preference as 'lameeee'.
    *   **Service:** Commends the 'nice lady' for allowing their 'rather large group' inside despite the dining room closing, indicating excellent customer accommodation and flexibility ('customer service was so great').
    *   **Atmosphere/Amenities:** Mentions a 24-hour drive-thru and the dining room situation, showcasing operational aspects.
    *   **Value:** Implied positive value with the phrase 'TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!' and the strong preference over chain competitors.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The likelihood of recommendation is exceptionally high. The reviewer not only strongly recommends the establishment ('Just go to Bosa') but actively dissuades potential customers from visiting competitors ('No more KKreme or DDonuts... you will never go to a chain donut shop again'). This is a powerful, unqualified endorsement.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The severity of complaints is virtually non-existent. The initial 'only thing' about expecting a Krispy Kreme-like texture is immediately mitigated and reframed as 'homemade delicious.' The reviewer even calls the preference for light airy donuts 'lameeee' and attributes the '4/5 star instead of 5/5' to representing a *minority* opinion within their group, not personal dissatisfaction. The potential issue with the dining room closing was handled so positively by staff that it became a highlight of excellent service. Therefore, there are no meaningful or personal complaints that detract from the overall exceptional experience.

**Conclusion:** Despite the reviewer's explanation for giving 4 stars (which appears to be an attempt at journalistic fairness for a minority opinion within their group, rather than a reflection of their personal experience), the actual content, sentiment, language intensity, specific positive feedback, and overwhelming recommendation clearly describe an 'Exceptional experience, highly enthusiastic, strong recommendation, minimal/no complaints.' The reviewer's personal feelings and advocacy align perfectly with a 5-star rating.","```json

"Was not satisfied first trip, service was awful and place was deafening.  But we thought food was worth trying again.  So, now that the place has been open and matured it is much better.  Our sever was good, the place was about 1/2 empty which made the noise level much more bearable.
Food, very good.  Not chicago family run good, but for the valley very good.
I asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was.  Hsb can't handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested.  The mustard wraps, unusual and tasty.  Hsb loved the peanut sauce.  Chicken and lemongrass salad, good flavors.  We will be back.",4,4,"This review presents a nuanced evaluation based on two distinct visits. The dominant emotional tone shifts from initially negative to overwhelmingly positive. The first trip evoked strong negative sentiments ('not satisfied', 'awful' service, 'deafening' atmosphere). However, the core of the review focuses on the *second* visit, where the experience significantly improved.

Language intensity is notable. While 'awful' and 'deafening' describe the first trip, the second trip is characterized by 'much better,' 'good' (server), 'much more bearable' (noise), and 'very good' (food, repeated twice). The explicit mention of 'loved' (peanut sauce) and 'unusual and tasty' further elevates the positive sentiment. The comparison 'Not chicago family run good, but for the valley very good' is a specific, high compliment within its local context.

Specific feedback is rich and detailed for the second visit: the server was good, the noise level was bearable (due to 1/2 capacity), and the food was highly praised with specific examples: shrimp made spicy as requested, curried duck made mild as requested, unusual and tasty mustard wraps, loved peanut sauce, and good flavors in the chicken and lemongrass salad.

Recommendation likelihood is extremely high, explicitly stated with 'We will be back.' This signifies strong satisfaction and intent for future patronage.

Complaint severity refers mostly to the first trip, with those issues (service, noise) being significantly mitigated or resolved on the second visit. There are no major complaints about the second visit, only a minor qualifier for 'very good' food against a very high external standard. Overall, the review highlights a very positive and improved experience, leading to a strong recommendation to return.","```json

"I don't know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on.

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer uses highly enthusiastic language such as 'how can you not love them?', 'makes Tempe Sales great', and strongly recommends the store with phrases like 'please do yourself a favor and check it out' and 'I bet that you will return soon thereafter'.

The reviewer details a personal experience where the owner, Alan, went out of his way to provide free sublayment material during a large purchase and notes that the staff (many family members) are helpful with reupholstery and 'odd jobs,' creating a welcoming environment for amateurs.

Recommendation likelihood is extremely high, with explicit encouragement to visit and a prediction of return visits just to browse. Complaint severity is minimal; the reviewer mentions 'unreliable stock levels' and past 'disorganization' but immediately downplays these by stating they 'also make the experience more interesting' and that the disorganization is 'much better now than in the past.' These minor points do not detract from the overall glowing assessment, fitting the criteria for an exceptional experience with minimal to no significant complaints.","```json

"I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldn't let her drink alone. And oh, I'm so glad I'm such a good friend. 

The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing.

"As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had! I would much rather come here than IHOP",4,5,"The reviewer expresses a highly positive and enthusiastic sentiment, particularly emphasizing the restaurant's comfort and kid-friendliness, which addresses a significant pain point for them as a parent of young children. This aspect is framed with high intensity, contrasting it sharply with negative experiences at other establishments ('evil looks and comments for bringing kids (Carraba's)'). The food quality is consistently rated as 'good' and 'pretty good and inexpensive,' with an exceptional highlight for the 'french fries are some of the best I've had!', which uses strong superlative language. There are absolutely no complaints directed at this restaurant; the minor qualification 'Not great, but pretty good' is offset by the 'always been good' and the specific praise for the fries and value. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I would much rather come here than IHOP,' indicating a strong recommendation and high likelihood of return. Given how perfectly this establishment meets the reviewer's specific needs and preferences (comfort, kid-friendliness, good value, excellent fries, and no negative judgment), it represents an exceptional experience for them, leading to a 5-star rating.","```json

"the things I liked:

the cart.
 it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.)
You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Fry's, and its a bummer.
Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason.
the steering on the carts was easy like ikea's carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver.

The food.
Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked. 
I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss)
They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or don't, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff.
It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store.

Last grabs.
If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever.

One of these things is not like the other...
so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheeto's? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have?

They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX)

$.
Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same. 
they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce.

you will definitely see me there again.",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer is highly enthusiastic, providing extensive detail about numerous aspects they liked, from the unique cart features (prior to the update) to the store's approach to food branding, product selection, and pricing strategy. The language used, while not overly dramatic, conveys genuine satisfaction and appreciation for specific store attributes, such as 'easy steering like Ikea's carts' and feeling 'purchasing it for the quality of food.'

Specific feedback is rich and varied, covering carts, food quality perception, ease of shopping, product range, value, and even payment methods. The updates demonstrate an engaged reviewer who has continued to observe the store. While there are a few minor criticisms or observations (e.g., 'prepared food is kinda hit or miss,' the confusion about Cheetos, initial AMEX exclusion, which was later resolved), none of these are severe enough to detract significantly from the overall positive experience. The initial update about the small carts being removed is a negative change, but the core of the review focuses on the *benefits* of those carts and other aspects.

Crucially, the reviewer explicitly states, 'you will definitely see me there again,' which is a strong indication of a high recommendation likelihood and a very positive overall experience. The complaints are either personal preferences, minor observations, or issues that were later resolved. Therefore, this review clearly aligns with an 'Exceptional experience, highly enthusiastic, strong recommendation, minimal/no complaints' rating.","```json

"I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.",4,3,"This review presents a classic mixed experience, leaning towards mild disappointment regarding value and room quality, which aligns well with a 3-star rating. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is mixed to mildly disappointed. The reviewer explicitly states 'mixed feelings' and that the resort is 'somewhat overrated' for the price. While there are strong positives for the common areas, the overall feeling is one of unmet expectations.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language used is moderately intense. Positive descriptions like 'absolutely phenomenal' for the lobby and grounds contrast with more subdued and critical terms for the room such as 'less impressive,' 'nothing extra,' 'not overly impressive,' 'just average,' and 'small TV.' The concluding 'average room. Nothing less, nothing more' summarizes the lack of exceptionalism.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Overall Value:** Perceived as 'overrated' and 'expected more for the price.'
    *   **Resort Layout:** Described as like a 'fantastically designed apartment complex,' possibly a conversion.
    *   **Common Areas (Lobby/Grounds):** Highly praised as 'absolutely phenomenal,' 'stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious.'
    *   **Room:** Criticized for being 'less impressive,' having only 'most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra.' Specific complaints include uninspired artwork, average linens, and a small TV. The room is explicitly called 'average.'
    *   **Balcony/Deck:** Positively noted as 'very nice' and suitable for studying.
    *   **Location:** Good, 'close to everything.'
    *   **Service/Food:** Not mentioned.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer offers a conditional and lukewarm recommendation: 'If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room.' This is not a strong endorsement, but rather a pragmatic suggestion with a significant caveat.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are not severe in terms of functional failures or poor service. Instead, they are related to the disparity between the common areas and the private room experience, and the overall value for money. The issues are aesthetic and expectation-based ('average room') rather than egregious problems that would deter all visitors.","```json

"Okay, eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird.  But after getting off of long flights, my mother and I needed some kind of Asian food and quick.  The GPS was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears.

I give these guys major kudos for the portion size.  Seriously, I felt like I was still in Texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me.  And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and they didn't skimp on the meat.  My mom's soup had to be improvised since they'd run out of octopus.  They asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter.  Sure, it was tasty, but she was really disappointed.  The fried spring rolls were okay, but they were tiny and not piping hot.

This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot.  It came out quickly and the service was quite friendly (though not quite professional).  I'm all about supporting the mom-and-pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents, I feel for them even more (been there, done that).  With a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel, this place will continue to attract more and more clients.",4,4,"The review presents a predominantly positive experience, with strong highlights in food quality for key dishes and efficient, friendly service, which aligns well with a 4-star rating ('Very good experience, mostly positive, minor issues mentioned, would likely return').

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and appreciative, with elements of minor disappointment and constructive criticism. The reviewer expresses 'major kudos' for portion size, describes the Pad Thai as 'delicious' and 'perfectly cooked,' and notes that the food 'hit the spot.' They also appreciate the 'friendly' service and speed. However, there's clear disappointment regarding the mother's soup due to a missing ingredient and a neutral-to-negative take on the spring rolls ('okay,' 'tiny,' 'not piping hot'). The initial impression of the atmosphere being 'kinda weird' is also noted.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language uses several positive intensifiers: 'major kudos,' 'enormous plate,' 'delicious,' and 'perfectly cooked.' On the negative side, 'really disappointed' stands out for the mother's experience. However, there are no extreme or hyperbolic negative terms like 'terrible' or 'awful,' indicating that even the complaints are not catastrophic.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Food Quality:** Excellent for Pad Thai (portion size, taste, ingredients). Mixed for soup (tasty, but disappointing due to missing octopus). Subpar for spring rolls (tiny, not hot enough). Good value implied by portion size.
    *   **Service:** Quick food delivery, 'quite friendly' staff, accommodating when an ingredient was out (offering alternatives). A minor note of 'not quite professional' is made.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Described as 'kinda weird' due to an 'old diner' feel, with suggestions for remodeling.
    *   **Other:** Needs 'better parking lot.' Reviewer expresses support for 'mom-and-pop shops' and empathizes with working kids.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer states, 'This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot,' indicating overall satisfaction. The concluding remarks, 'With a better parking lot and some remodeling... this place will continue to attract more and more clients,' suggest a strong belief in the business's potential and a implicit recommendation for others to visit, provided they are aware of the minor issues.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints are generally minor. The 'kinda weird' atmosphere and 'not quite professional' service are observations rather than severe issues. The spring rolls were 'okay' but lacked warmth/size. The most significant complaint is the mother's 'really disappointed' reaction to the missing octopus, although the staff handled the situation by offering alternatives. These issues are not severe enough to overshadow the strong positives, leading to a net positive assessment.","```json

"Headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he's lived in Phx for decades and recommended this place (although he hadn't been there in many years). I got a Super Sicilian. Absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty. If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the ""all-American grinder"" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos. Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!

PS: Parking? The boss just parked his Ram 2500HD and toy trailer around the corner on the street in front of someone's house. No problem and no parking meters. (shrug)",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, strongly warranting a 5-star rating. The reviewer uses high-intensity positive language such as 'Absolutely delicious' and describes the bread as 'soft and tasty.' They express a clear intent to 'definitely return' once their office shifts downtown, indicating a very high recommendation likelihood.

Specific feedback on food quality is excellent, with a detailed description of the 'Super Sicilian' sandwich and its 'soft and tasty' sesame bread. The reviewer even offers a favorable comparison to another well-regarded local sandwich ('all-American grinder' at Uncle Sam's). Furthermore, they provide helpful, positive specific feedback on parking, stating 'No problem and no parking meters.'

While two 'criticisms' are offered, their severity is very low. The 10-minute wait for a sandwich is noted as 'inexplicably' long but not described as a major inconvenience or poor service. The complaint about the sandwich being 'too small' is immediately self-corrected by the reviewer ('My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those'), turning it into a humorous personal observation rather than a true fault of the restaurant's portioning or value. This self-correction and the expressed desire to simply order more next time ('sub and a half') underscores the positive experience rather than detracting from it. Overall, the enthusiasm and strong desire to return, coupled with the minimal and self-mitigated criticisms, firmly place this review in the 5-star category.","```json

"Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think that's when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food won't taste right.)  I think I'm gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly.",4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, clearly indicating an exceptional experience. The sentiment is extremely high, with the reviewer using strong positive language such as 'service was great,' 'loved this place,' and 'Awesome' to describe the food. Specific feedback is provided for both service and food quality: the service included a memorable and personable interaction with the owner sharing a spring roll, which deeply impressed the reviewer.

"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, bordering on enthusiastic rapture, which strongly supports a 5-star rating. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of high satisfaction, delight, and anticipation. Phrases like 'satisfy my crave,' 'very clean,' 'ready to serve,' 'clearly explained,' 'very friendly,' 'lots of patience,' 'What a great deal!', 'must come back,' 'excuse me as I wipe my drool,' 'WOW!', 'I LOVE IT!!!', 'just so good!', 'A definitely must have,' and 'can't wait' all underscore a profoundly positive experience. Even the initial slight reservation about the Bavarian cream is quickly mitigated and reframed positively.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The reviewer uses highly intensive language throughout. Superlatives and strong adjectives ('very clean,' 'great deal,' 'curvy, pretty looking') are common. Exclamations ('What a great deal!', 'WOW!', 'I LOVE IT!!!') and hyperbolic expressions ('wipe my drool') convey extreme pleasure. The reviewer's conversion from 'not a big fan of caramel' to 'I LOVE IT!!!' for the flautas highlights exceptional positive impact.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review is rich with concrete details: 
    *   **Service:** Exceptional. Miguel is praised for being friendly, patient, conversational, and helpful in explaining items (due to Spanish labels).
    *   **Atmosphere:** 'Very clean.'
    *   **Value:** Outstanding. 10 pastries for $6.80 is highlighted as 'What a great deal!'
    *   **Food Quality:** Detailed descriptions of pastries are provided. While the Bavarian cream was 'not as creamy' as expected, it was still considered a 'nice added flavor.' The pineapple-filled pastry was 'just fine' and not too sweet, leading to 'drool.' The caramel flautas received an 'EH' and 'UM' initially but quickly turned into 'WOW!' and 'I LOVE IT!!!' by the third bite. The reviewer also detailed other menu items (tamales, burritos, menudo) and the homemade tortillas, building strong anticipation for future visits.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely high. The reviewer explicitly states 'I must come back and try it' for the burritos and 'A definitely must have for next time' for the caramel flautas. The closing 'I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies' confirms a strong intent to return and continue exploring.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** Minimal to non-existent. The 'Bavarian wasn't as creamy' is the only 'complaint,' but it's immediately softened and integrated into a positive overall assessment ('nice added flavor when you eat it all together'). The burritos 'weren't ready yet' is a minor inconvenience that only fuels future anticipation, not dissatisfaction with the current experience. There are no serious issues or strong negative remarks.","```json

"My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tv's so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time we've ever had poor food is when we do pick up. It's always been hit or miss then. We've never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars.",4,4,"The review demonstrates a predominantly positive sentiment, with strong affection for the restaurant ('love Crust', 'frequent here often', 'always enjoy ourselves'). The language intensity is high on the positive side, using superlatives such as 'amazing pizza', 'awesome service', 'great wine selection', and 'very unique' for the red blend. Specific feedback is abundant, detailing positive aspects of food quality (Rustica portion, good whole wheat crust), excellent service, a pleasant albeit sometimes noisy casual atmosphere, and a notable wine selection. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high for dining in, as the reviewer is a frequent and loyal customer who consistently enjoys their visits.

However, a specific complaint regarding food quality ('poor food', 'hit or miss') is explicitly mentioned, but it is severely quarantined to 'when we do pick up.' The reviewer makes a clear distinction by stating, 'We've never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant,' which significantly mitigates the severity of this complaint for the in-house dining experience. The comment about noise when full is a minor observation, not a complaint. Given the overwhelming positivity for dine-in experiences and the containment of the main negative point to pick-up orders, the review aligns perfectly with a 4-star rating: a 'very good experience, mostly positive, minor issues mentioned, would likely return.' The reviewer's own stated rating of 4 stars is consistent with this analysis.","```json

"This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat.
   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.",4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, clearly indicating an exceptional experience for the reviewer. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of strong admiration and affection for Tony's. The reviewer champions the establishment's unique character, value, and specific food items, even defending it against potential criticisms (like cleanliness) by reframing them positively.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language is highly intense and filled with superlatives, especially when describing the atmosphere and the Sicilian olives. Phrases like 'bona-fide living history museum,' 'faded, festive charm,' 'palpable sense of eras past,' and descriptions of the olives as 'deeply rich, complex, meaty, satisfying, delicious, addicting, sublime' demonstrate extreme enthusiasm. The reviewer also uses evocative, poetic language, particularly in the final sections.

**3. Specific Feedback:** 
*   **Atmosphere:** Highly praised as a 'cultural experience,' a 'living history museum' with family presence, mementos, and a charming, dusty aesthetic evoking past eras. 
*   **Service:** Positive, highlighting the family's presence and helpfulness.
*   **Cleanliness:** Addressed directly and reframed positively as 'European Standard,' dismissing germaphobic concerns and integrating 'dust' into the 'faded, festive charm.'
*   **Food Quality:** Mixed for some items (dislikes sausage grind) but overwhelmingly positive for others. 'Sliced meats and cheeses are very good,' 'subs' are recommended, 'cannoli' are a 'bargain,' 'bulk olives' are good value, and the 'Sicilian olives' receive exceptionally high, almost poetic praise, being described as 'addicting' and 'sublime.'
*   **Value:** Repeatedly highlights excellent value for cannoli and various olives, often with price comparisons.
*   **Groceries:** Mentions checking expiration dates as a general precaution, but frames it as a common issue, not unique to Tony's.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Very high. The reviewer explicitly encourages others, especially 'the more adventurous sort,' to visit 'for the cultural experience' and 'to at least poke your nose into Tony's.' Specific food items (subs, cannoli, and particularly the Sicilian olives – 'Try at least ONE in your lifetime') are strongly recommended.

**5. Complaint Severity:** Extremely low. The few negative points mentioned (personal dislike for sausage grind, general advice to check grocery expiration dates, inconsistent garlic in olives) are presented as minor inconveniences, personal preferences, or easily rectifiable suggestions rather than significant flaws. They do not detract from the overwhelmingly positive overall sentiment and are often mitigated or reframed by the reviewer.","```json

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and appreciative. Phrases like 'so many samples,' 'really good!' (for specific flavors), and 'yummy sweetness in life' convey enjoyment. There's a lighthearted, satisfied feeling about the experience, even with the caloric compensation joke. The concluding 'it's fine for Chandler' suggests acceptance and suitability, not disappointment.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to strong positive. 'So many samples' and 'really good!' are enthusiastic descriptors. The complaint 'a little too sweet' is mild and subjective, not extreme. The comparison to 'Anderson's Frozen Custard' serves as a benchmark rather than an extreme negative, tempered by 'but it's fine for Chandler,' which pulls it back to a positive assessment for the local context.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** While not explicitly stating 'I recommend this place,' the overall positive tone, the praise for specific items, and the general enjoyment ('wholesome, yummy sweetness') strongly imply a likelihood to recommend, especially within the context of Chandler.

"I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyro's, but now I can't get enough!

I don't go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak, rice, pinto beans, and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu, but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time I'll try something other than the chicken - since it's super bland.

The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is), just step outside, place a phone order, then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order, because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  I've made an order with my iPhone twice now, and it couldn't be easier.

The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time, from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor.",4,4,"The reviewer expresses an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, starting with 'can't get enough!' and describing their preferred burrito bowl combo as 'best...combo...ever!', indicating high enthusiasm.

However, the reviewer explicitly states, 'The only reason this place got 4 stars was because...' and then details specific complaints: the steak, while 'awesome most of the time,' is 'kinda tough' from time to time, suggesting a quality inconsistency.

"What a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown Phoenix.  Sitting outside on an April afternoon, listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze (thanks to the misters), I felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I really dug the atmosphere, and the food was delicious.  The Vegetarian Omelet was yummy, bursting with veggies, and the olives gave it a great flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted.  I also had a few bites of the Banana Fosters French Toast, which is waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal.  The coffee is good enough to drink black.",4,5,"The reviewer expresses an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment throughout the entire review.

"Went on Halloween night for dinner.  Very good.  The steak came out sizzling in butter, the way God intended good steak to be.  Service was great but they put a bottle of San Pelligrino and poured it before asking us, now I would normally buy it because I like it and for $8 it is a nice add on, but they should ask first.  Also, beware: the Wedge Salad is just iceburg lettuce and Blue Cheese dressing, NO BACON!!  WTF?  No Bacon, but I asked for a side and it was all good.  Desert was just OK, and their side dishes were above average.  Great for special occasion.  Will go back.  Oh they don't have jack on tap if you want a good draft.  I was really let down with their poor beer selection.",4,4,"The reviewer experienced a 'very good' visit overall, punctuated by several strong positives and a few specific, albeit intensely expressed, negatives. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive. The review starts with 'Very good' and explicitly states 'Will go back.' Strong positive language is used for the steak ('sizzling in butter, the way God intended'), service ('great'), and general occasion ('Great for special occasion'). Negative sentiments are focused on specific aspects: procedural (San Pelligrino), menu omissions (Wedge Salad bacon), and beverage selection (beer).

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language is quite intense on both ends of the spectrum. Highly enthusiastic phrases like 'the way God intended good steak to be' and 'Service was great' showcase strong satisfaction. Conversely, 'NO BACON!! WTF?' and 'really let down with their poor beer selection' demonstrate strong disappointment for those specific issues. This mix suggests highs were very high, but certain lows were genuinely frustrating for the reviewer.

3.  **Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Food Quality:** The steak was exceptional. Side dishes were 'above average.' Dessert was 'just OK.' The Wedge Salad was a major disappointment due to the lack of bacon, though the reviewer managed to get a side and resolve it to their satisfaction.
    *   **Service:** Described as 'great.'
    *   **Atmosphere/Occasion:** Recommended as 'Great for special occasion.'
    *   **Beverages:** Complaint about San Pelligrino being poured without asking (though they would normally buy it). A significant disappointment was the 'poor beer selection' and lack of 'jack on tap.'
    *   **Value:** The $8 for San Pelligrino is mentioned, seemingly as an acceptable add-on if asked.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'Will go back,' which is a strong indicator of a positive recommendation and likelihood to return.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** The complaints about San Pelligrino and the 'just OK' dessert are minor. The 'NO BACON!! WTF?' for the Wedge Salad is a passionate complaint about a specific menu item, but it seems to have been somewhat mitigated. The 'poor beer selection' and being 'really let down' by it represents the most significant and unaddressed complaint for the reviewer, as it genuinely impacted their experience for a specific preference. 

**Overall Evaluation:** Despite the strong language regarding the bacon and beer selection, the core experience—exceptional steak, great service, and above-average sides—was highly positive. The explicit 'Will go back' and the overall 'Very good' sentiment outweigh the specific frustrations. It fits the 'Very good experience, mostly positive, minor issues mentioned, would likely return' description, preventing a 5-star rating due to the intensity and nature of some complaints, especially the beer selection.","```json

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and appreciative.

Words like ""well stocked"" and ""great"" are used to describe positive aspects, indicating strong satisfaction with particular categories of goods. ""Nice"" also conveys a clear positive sentiment. There are no extreme superlatives (e.g., 'amazing', 'terrible') used, indicating satisfaction rather than overwhelming enthusiasm or deep disappointment.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer is highly likely to recommend this store, especially to others seeking Japanese basics or a local alternative to larger Asian markets. The phrase ""nice to have a local Japanese grocer"" and the clear intent to return for prepared food (""I'll have to try the prepared food sometime"") strongly suggest a positive recommendation.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are minor. ""Not a lot of fresh produce"" is an observation about the store's scope rather than a flaw in what it does offer.

"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",4,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, despite a potentially severe allergy incident. The reviewer's initial 'Platonic Ideal' framing sets a very high bar, stating Vintage 95 is 'damn close' but 'isn't quite there' at the outset. However, the subsequent detailed descriptions of their experience, especially the exemplary handling of the food allergy, elevate the overall sentiment to exceptional.

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of high enthusiasm, deep satisfaction, and strong appreciation. Even when detailing personal pet peeves (loud music), the reviewer praises Vintage 95 for avoiding them. The resolution of the allergy mistake garners profound gratitude and respect.

**Language Intensity:** The review is filled with superlatives and strong positive language: 'terrific,' 'very fine visual experience,' 'CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION' (as a positive for V95), 'EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY,' 'fabulous leather club chairs,' 'pretty good selection,' 'perfect dirtiness,' 'VERY nice,' 'nicely balanced and very interesting,' 'darn delicious,' 'VERY tasty,' 'HIGHLY recommended,' 'unusual,' 'EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see,' 'BIG Kudos,' 'outstanding customer service,' 'DEFINTELY be back,' and 'strongly recommend.' The initial 'damn close' for the Platonic Ideal is itself a high compliment.

**Specific Feedback:** The review provides exceptionally detailed and concrete feedback across all aspects:
*   **Location:** Terrific, downtown Chandler.
*   **Atmosphere:** Very fine visual experience (leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting), conversation-friendly music level (a major positive), comfortable seating (leather couches, fireplace, bar stools, amazing patio).
*   **Drinks:** Good selection of single malt scotches beyond the usual, specific mention of Ardbeg, reasonably priced for a restaurant. Caroline's martini was 'perfect.'
*   **Food:** Happy Hour bruschetta (unusual, diverse choices, well-balanced, interesting), smoked tomato bisque (creamy, smoky, well-balanced, unique, delicious). Vintage burger (very tasty, good beef, fresh bun, tasty fixin's, highly recommended) with nicely cooked and seasoned fries. Apple pie (unusual, fresh puff pastry, tender apples, cinnamon/sugar, salted dolce la leche, tasty).
*   **Service:** Attentive hostesses. Crucially, the waiter and owner (Gavin) handled a dessert allergy mistake with immediate concern, asking about emergency assistance. This response was highlighted as 'EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see,' demonstrating 'kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.'

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.' This is a full, unequivocal recommendation.

**Complaint Severity:** The only minor 'complaint' is Caroline's preference for less crispy bread for the bruschetta. The significant event was the accidental serving of a dessert containing hazelnut (an allergen for the reviewer). While this was a serious mistake that *could have* led to disaster, the reviewer explicitly states 'to their credit - it didn't.' The severity of the *mistake* is high, but the *complaint* about the service handling is non-existent; instead, the service recovery transformed a potential negative into a monumental positive, demonstrating exceptional customer care. The reviewer directly says 'no harm, no foul' regarding the mistake itself, due to the excellent recovery.

**Conclusion:** Despite the initial 'not quite there' in relation to a personal 'Platonic Ideal,' the overall experience, especially the superlative service recovery, pushed this into the 'exceptional' category. The enthusiasm, strong recommendations, detailed positive feedback, and the transformation of a serious error into an example of outstanding service align perfectly with a 5-star rating.","```json

"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.

It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.

We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.

I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.

If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!",4,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment. The language intensity is high, featuring phrases like 'pleased with our experience,' 'quite the character,' 'made us laugh quite a bit,' 'attentive,' 'hip colorful atmosphere,' 'everything was light and tasted fresh,' 'really enjoyed the dipping sauces,' 'huge selection,' 'can't wait to return,' 'highly recommend,' 'Such a deal!,' and 'I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to.'

Specific feedback is abundant and positive across all key areas: 
- **Service:** Praised for prompt seating and an 'attentive' server, Al, who was a 'character' and 'made us laugh quite a bit,' also offering recommendations.
- **Atmosphere:** Described as a 'stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere.' They noted a covered patio with misters, mitigating the 'tad bit too hot to sit outside.'
- **Food:** 'Firecracker shrimp,' 'spider roll,' 'shrimp roll,' and 'zen salad' were highlighted as 'light and tasted fresh.' The 'dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls' were particularly enjoyed, and the 'huge selection of the spring rolls' left the reviewer eager to return. The 'custom create a bit upon request' for entrees mitigated the observation about a non-huge selection.
- **Value:** The reviewer enthusiastically detailed and 'highly recommend[ed]' the 'food happy hour' ($6 appetizers & $1 off spring rolls) and 'drinks happy hour' (discounted specialty drinks, wine, wells, and draft beer), calling them 'Such a deal!'

The recommendation likelihood is exceptionally high, with explicit statements ('highly recommend,' 'can't wait to return') and strong implicit intent ('I could see myself being a regular,' 'keep it high on my list of spots to return to').

Complaint severity is minimal to non-existent. The only 'issues' mentioned – 'tad bit too hot to sit outside' (mitigated by misters) and 'If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home' – are minor personal preferences or external factors, not direct criticisms of the restaurant's quality or offerings. The observation about the entree selection was immediately followed by a positive note on customizability. This review unequivocally represents an exceptional 5-star experience.","```json

"Went for dinner before a Suns game on a Tuesday, got there at 5 and got right in, but the place filled up fast after us.  The atmosphere is awesome, a little brick house split into small rooms with a huge patio dining area.  The service was quality over all.  Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections.",4,4,"The dominant emotional tone is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses strong positive language and superlatives for ambiance (""awesome""), the Burrata appetizer (""awesome,"" ""melt in your mouth,"" ""pork butter,"" ""lovely""), and the general quality (""quality over all,"" ""definately quality""). While there are minor complaints regarding a lapse in service during the meal and the pizza crust not meeting personal expectations (despite acknowledging quality ingredients), these are framed as minor issues that do not detract significantly from the overall positive experience. The reviewer explicitly states, ""I would definately recommend Cibo"" and ""I plan on going back to try some more selections."" The complaints are low in severity; the service issue was a temporary attentiveness lapse, not rudeness or a major error, and the pizza critique was a subjective preference for crust style rather than a quality defect. This aligns perfectly with a 4-star rating: a very good, mostly positive experience with minor issues and a strong likelihood of return.","```json

I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!,5,5,"The dominant emotional tone is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, shifting from initial long-term curiosity to profound satisfaction. The language intensity is high, featuring strong positive descriptors such as 'very impressed,' 'Awesome salads,' 'absolutely melted in my mouth,' and the explicit 'definitely go back!'

While the reviewer initially perceived the place as 'pricier that we thought,' this mild concern was immediately and completely overridden by the quality of the meal ('we forgot the price once the meals arrived'), indicating exceptional value for money despite the cost. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high and explicitly stated ('We will definitely go back!'). There are no significant complaints; the only minor issue (price) was immediately negated and forgotten, demonstrating a truly exceptional experience that fully aligns with a 5-star rating.","```json

"I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream. 

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.",5,5,"The review demonstrates an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, despite the reviewer's self-admitted personal struggle with indecision in such an abundant environment. The language is highly enthusiastic and uses superlatives such as 'glorious, wholesome products,' 'meticulously organized,' 'foodie's dream,' and 'Bliss' to describe the experience. Specific feedback is plentiful, highlighting the extensive product variety ('ten varieties of every type of item'), the quality of prepared foods (fresh spicy tuna, crisp Pacific salad roll, natural pickled ginger, satisfying cucumber salad), and the engaging atmosphere (live music). 

While the reviewer notes prices are 'a tad higher,' this is immediately mitigated by 'Then again, it is Whole Foods,' indicating an acceptance rather than a complaint. The 'word of advice' about coming with a game plan is presented as a helpful tip for navigating the store's sheer abundance, not as a severe criticism. There are no actual complaints about product quality, cleanliness, or service issues. The reviewer explicitly states, 'All in all, a very satisfying meal.' The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, as the 'negative' points are framed as consequences of the store's exceptional offerings and the reviewer's own nature, rather than flaws.

"Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. 

I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!

The language intensity is very high, utilizing strong superlatives and expressions of extreme satisfaction, such as 'never ever had a bad meal,' 'always have a hard time deciding,' 'hooked ever since' regarding a drink, and 'so good you'll be ordering another before you know it.'

"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! 

The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)",5,5,"The dominant emotional tone is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. The reviewer expresses anticipation ('been meaning to try this place for months'), satisfaction ('so glad'), and delight with the experience.

Language intensity is notably high on the positive side, utilizing strong descriptors such as 'delicious,' 'def recommend,' 'really fresh,' and 'perfect lunch spot'. While 'kind of slow' is mentioned regarding service, its intensity is immediately nullified by the reviewer's explicit statement: 'I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious!', indicating it did not detract from their overall satisfaction.

Specific feedback is provided across multiple categories: atmosphere (outdoor patio, perfect for lunch), food quality ('delicious,' 'really fresh'), and a specific dish (chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia) which receives a strong endorsement. Service is noted as slow, but its impact is consciously dismissed by the reviewer.

Recommendation likelihood is extremely high and explicit. The reviewer clearly states they 'would def recommend it' and concludes by calling it 'A perfect lunch spot :).

Complaint severity is very low. The single minor issue of slow service is immediately downplayed and explicitly stated by the reviewer as not warranting any star deduction, demonstrating that it did not diminish their exceptional experience. This aligns with the 'minimal/no complaints' aspect of a 5-star review as interpreted by the reviewer themselves.","```json

"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...

Just remember to bring cash",5,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, leading to a strong 5-star prediction. The reviewer begins with an enthusiastic 'Wow!' and describes Cafe Monarch as 'a highlight of my trip,' immediately setting a highly positive tone.

**Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of delight, satisfaction, and comfort. Words like 'cozy,' 'right at home,' 'perfectly cooked,' 'wonderful,' 'delicious,' and the overall enjoyment of the meal underscore this.

**Language Intensity:** The language used is highly enthusiastic and features several superlatives and strong positive descriptors. Examples include 'Wow!', 'highlight,' 'felt cozy and right at home,' 'perfectly cooked,' 'wonderful citrus sauce,' 'complemented perfectly,' and the concluding 'Simple, fresh, delicious.' The reviewer's decision to trust Chef Chris despite being 'picky about lamb' further emphasizes a high level of confidence and satisfaction.

**Specific Feedback:** The review provides excellent concrete details:
*   **Food Quality:** Highly praised lamb chops (thyme rubbed, perfectly cooked, wonderful citrus sauce) and spinach (prepared with garlic and a hint of mint, perfectly complementing the lamb). The overall food impression is summarized as 'Simple, fresh, delicious.'
*   **Service:** Direct, personalized interaction with Chef Chris, who asked for preferences and served the meal. The reviewer felt comfortable enough to 'leave myself in his hands,' indicating trust and good service.
*   **Atmosphere:** Described as 'cozy and right at home,' suggesting a warm and inviting environment.
*   **Value:** While not explicitly discussing price, the quality of the experience strongly implies high value for money.

**Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer's enthusiastic praise, specific positive details, and lack of any significant complaints strongly indicate a high likelihood of recommendation to others.

**Complaint Severity:** The only 'issue' mentioned is a practical tip: 'Just remember to bring cash.' This is a very low-severity point, a helpful piece of information rather than a complaint about the experience itself. It does not detract from the overwhelmingly positive review of the food, service, and atmosphere. If anything, it's a minor logistical note that doesn't impact the core dining experience's excellence.","```json

"i always forget about this place when we do a party. they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff. 

stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks. i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween. but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!",5,4,"The review presents a mixed initial sentiment but concludes with a strong positive recommendation for specific use cases. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is ultimately positive, despite initial frustration. The reviewer expresses disappointment regarding specific item availability (no Fred Flintstone costume) and price competitiveness (Wilma costume $50 in-store vs. $30 online). However, this is significantly outweighed by the enthusiastic concluding statement, deeming the place 'perfect!' for props, theme parties, or general dress-up.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to high. The reviewer uses factual comparisons for pricing but ends with a strong positive superlative: 'perfect!' This word carries significant positive weight and indicates high satisfaction for the store's core offering.

**3. Specific Feedback:** 
*   **Positives:** The store carries costumes and party gear year-round, including Halloween items. It's explicitly recommended as 'perfect' for props for costume/theme parties, bike pub rides, or general dressing up.
*   **Negatives:** Lack of a specific item (Fred Flintstone costume). Uncompetitive pricing for another specific item (Wilma costume $50 in-store vs. $30 online). The reviewer bought only house decor, not their primary intended purchase, seemingly due to price/availability issues.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** High. Despite not finding exactly what they wanted or at the price they desired for a specific item, the reviewer offers a clear and strong recommendation for anyone needing 'any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up.' This indicates they would recommend the store to others for its strengths.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints are mild in overall severity. They pertain to specific product availability and price competitiveness for particular items, rather than systemic issues like poor service, atmosphere, or general low quality. The reviewer still found value in purchasing house decor and left with a positive impression of the store's broader utility.","```json

3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.

5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.",5,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, demonstrating an exceptional experience with Southwest Airlines.

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of profound admiration, loyalty, and satisfaction. The reviewer expresses strong appreciation, bordering on adoration, for Southwest's service and policies, even stating they 'feel bad for the other airlines.'

Phrases like 'blows its competitors so far out of the water,' 'countless times,' 'NO BAG FEES' (capitalized for emphasis), 'Nine times out of ten,' and 'Killer customer service' clearly indicate an extreme level of positive sentiment.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete, detailed feedback across multiple critical aspects:

    *   **Value/Fees:** Highlights the significant benefit of 'NO BAG FEES' and often being the 'lowest price.'
    *   **Customer Service:** Praises 'killer customer service,' specifically noting its 'sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency,' which the reviewer clearly appreciates.
    *   **Customer Experience/Empathy:** Appreciates the non-judgmental attitude of flight attendants regarding early morning cocktail orders.

I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch.

The reviewer expresses a strong, enduring loyalty to the establishment, having gone 'out of their way to eat there MANY times!' and even taking an 'out of town friend here.' The sentiment is one of dedication and high satisfaction. Language intensity is high with superlatives like 'MANY times!', 'great' (about the new bigger location), 'delicious' for everything, and 'always a must!' for a specific item. 

Specific feedback highlights excellent food quality ('Everything is delicious,' 'mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!'), and a positive, nostalgic atmosphere (old place described as a 'hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way)'). The reviewer also speculates positively about the new location being 'bigger'. 

Recommendation likelihood is exceptionally high, evidenced by their repeated visits despite distance and their active recommendation to friends. 

The only point that could be perceived as negative is the observation that it 'can get really busy at lunch,' but this is immediately mitigated by the reviewer's own experience ('got in and out just fine') and framed as practical advice for fellow patrons rather than a complaint about service or the establishment itself. The 'complaint severity' is therefore extremely low, almost non-existent as a genuine grievance.

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!",5,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic.

"So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig. 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.",5,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment with a high degree of enthusiasm. The reviewer uses strong positive language and superlatives consistently, such as 'wonderful malbec,' 'deep fruity flavor,' 'went very well,' 'wonderful to have a bread,' 'flavorful, soft,' and 'very tasty.' The concluding statement, 'Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food,' further reinforces this positive tone.

Specific feedback is provided across multiple categories:
-   **Service:** Positive mention of server Tim who 'delivered' the requested wine, indicating attentive and effective service.
-   **Food & Drink:** Detailed positive descriptions of the malbec (heavy red, deep fruity flavor, hint of vanilla) and its pairing with a chocolate dessert. Crucially, the reviewer directly addresses a common complaint about the bread and bruschetta from other reviews, only to praise it highly ('wonderful,' 'did not destroy my gums,' 'flavorful, soft') and specifically highlight 'very tasty' toppings (Tapenade, Chimmichurri, Brie with fig).
-   **Atmosphere:** 'Thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance.'
-   **Convenience:** Positive note on 'not having to valet the car,' adding to the overall pleasant experience.

There are no complaints whatsoever about the reviewer's personal experience; instead, they actively refute common complaints found in other reviews, which strengthens their positive assessment. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, as the reviewer expresses thorough enjoyment and highlights multiple positive aspects without any reservations. This aligns perfectly with an exceptional experience.","```json

"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",5,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, clearly indicating an exceptional dining experience. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of delight, surprise, and profound satisfaction. The reviewer expresses regret for not visiting sooner ('Why did I wait so long!'), praises every aspect of their visit, and concludes with effusive gratitude. There's a strong sense of joy and discovery.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language intensity is very high, marked by numerous superlatives and strong descriptive words. Phrases like 'neighborhood hot spot!', 'lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio', 'wonderful job', 'perfectly crafted margaritas', 'order envy', 'AMAZZZZZZING!!!!', 'delectable treat', 'memorable dining experience', 'food was outstanding', and 'margaritas made by Phil are the best' demonstrate extreme enthusiasm and satisfaction. The use of all-caps ('AMAZZZZZZING!!!!') further amplifies this intensity.

**3. Specific Feedback:** The review provides highly specific and detailed feedback across all critical areas:
    *   **Food Quality:** Exceptional. Margaritas are 'perfectly crafted' and customized to strict preferences, described as 'the best'. The Pollo a la parilla is 'AMAZZZZZZING!!!!' with 'perfectly sautéed chicken breasts' and 'chipotle cream sauce'. Even the friend's Mole Poblano is acknowledged as award-winning. The Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie is a 'delectable treat'. The overall food is 'outstanding'.
    *   **Service:** Outstanding and personalized. 'Phil' (the waiter/bartender) is singled out for his 'full attention', 'wonderful job' guiding through selections, conveying personal favorites, skillfully crafting custom margaritas, and acting as a 'gastronomy guide' for dessert choices. This level of detail highlights exceptional, attentive, and knowledgeable service.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Very positive. The 'colorfully lit and lively patio' is a significant draw, enjoyed during 'beautiful weather', and described as enough to 'draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert'.
    *   **Value:** While 'pricier entree dishes' are noted, the reviewer immediately balances this by mentioning 'lesser priced authentic eats' like tacos and quesadillas, indicating a varied menu catering to different price points, and implying good value for the quality received.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** Extremely high. The opening 'Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!' is a direct, enthusiastic endorsement. The conclusion reiterates a strong desire to return ('patio alone is enough to draw me back') and explicitly thanks the establishment for a 'memorable dining experience', leaving no doubt about a strong recommendation.

**5. Complaint Severity:** Non-existent. There are no complaints whatsoever about the restaurant, its food, service, or atmosphere. The mention of the Cardinal's loss is an external, humorous aside and not related to the restaurant's performance. The note about 'pricier entree dishes' is a descriptive observation, not a complaint, especially since other affordable options are highlighted.","```json

"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!",5,5,"This review earns a 5-star rating due to its overwhelmingly positive sentiment and use of strong superlatives. 

1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is extremely enthusiastic and highly positive. Phrases like 'The best' and 'period!' convey absolute satisfaction and conviction. The additional comment 'And I hate chain restaurants!' further amplifies the positive perception of the reviewed establishment by contrasting it with something the reviewer dislikes, implying this restaurant offers a superior, non-chain experience.
2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is very high. 'The best' is a definitive superlative, indicating the peak of quality in the reviewer's opinion. 'Period!' serves as an emphatic punctuation, leaving no room for doubt. 'I hate' is a strong emotional word, though directed externally, it reinforces the strong positive feeling for the reviewed place by comparison.
3.  **Specific Feedback:** The review provides concrete feedback on 'fish tacos,' identifying them as a specific menu item of exceptional quality. While it doesn't detail service, atmosphere, or value, the singular focus on an outstanding food item is powerful and sufficient for a top rating given the intensity of the praise.
4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The likelihood of recommendation is extremely high. Declaring something 'The best, period!' is a clear and strong endorsement, signaling that the reviewer would undoubtedly recommend this particular dish, and by extension, the restaurant itself, to others.
5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are absolutely no complaints about the restaurant itself. The 'complaint' about chain restaurants is an external reference that indirectly elevates the reviewed establishment, suggesting it possesses qualities superior to what the reviewer typically dislikes.

"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time. 

The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place.",5,4,"The review presents a predominantly positive and informative evaluation of Try Me Bicycle Shop. 

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is positive and appreciative. The reviewer highlights the shop's longevity (nearly 40 years), unique inventory of 'odd' and 'hard-to-find parts', and 'good service', along with a practical perk like 'free air'. The phrase 'that makes this place' encapsulates the reviewer's positive view of these attributes.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language is descriptive and positive but not overly enthusiastic or using extreme superlatives. Words like 'odd part', 'hard-to-find parts', and 'good service' are strong positives for a specialized shop but don't reach the 'exceptional' or 'amazing' level that might warrant 5 stars.

Specific Feedback:** Concrete details provided include the shop's location ('western edge of Foothill Acres'), its history ('nearly 40 years'), its specialized inventory ('odd part for every type of bike', 'cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used', 'old and hard-to-find parts'), the absence of a specific type of product ('No high end bikes here'), 'good service', and the amenity of 'free air'.

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** While an explicit recommendation isn't made, the consistent positive descriptions and lack of any complaints strongly suggest the reviewer would recommend this shop, particularly to individuals seeking its specific niche offerings (vintage parts, comfort bikes, good local service).

**5. Complaint Severity:** There are no complaints mentioned. The statement 'No high end bikes here' is a factual clarification of the shop's inventory focus rather than a negative issue or dissatisfaction.

**Overall Justification for 4 Stars:** The review details a very good experience, emphasizing distinct positive features like specialized inventory and good service. It lacks any significant negatives or complaints. However, the language, while positive, doesn't reach the 'highly enthusiastic' or 'exceptional' level of intensity often associated with a 5-star rating.

"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! 

Check this place out!",5,5,"The reviewer expresses an exceptionally positive and enthusiastic experience, characterized by high-intensity language like 'yummy' (repeatedly), 'awesome,' 'excellent,' 'drools,' and 'GOOOOOD!'

"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?",5,5,"This Yelp review is overwhelmingly positive, showcasing an exceptional experience. The reviewer's sentiment is one of extreme enthusiasm, bordering on reverence, as indicated by the title 'Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)' and the 'Pavlov' conclusion. The language intensity is consistently high, employing superlatives and strong positive descriptors for every dish: 'incredible' smells, 'Stellar' soup, 'Phenomenal' Papaya Salad ('most awesome experience,' 'Beautiful'), 'Umami' Peanut Curry ('masterful crescendo,' 'done perfectly'), and 'Yum,' 'delicious,' 'delectable' Coconut Ice Cream. 

Specific feedback is abundant and highly detailed regarding food quality, praising specific flavors, textures, and even the creative presentation (the 'Masai-esqe cage of cabbage' for shrimp). The service is also highlighted positively, with the reviewer mentioning Lisa's patience and the thoughtful inquiry about heat preference for each item. While atmosphere isn't a focal point, the 'smells are incredible' and the appreciation for 'family-run places' contribute to a positive impression. Value is implied through the high satisfaction, even if not explicitly stated.

Recommendation likelihood is exceptionally high, explicitly stated with 'I will be back. I plan to have every dish vegetarian style. Family-run places are truly number 1.' The 'Pavlov' reference strongly indicates a conditioned, highly enthusiastic desire to return and recommend. Complaint severity is minimal to non-existent; any minor issues mentioned (website closing time discrepancy, personal parking challenges, a texture preference with coconut pulp) are either self-deprecating or personal quirks that do not detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience, and are often turned into part of the humorous narrative. This review clearly indicates an exceptional experience with no significant complaints, meriting a 5-star rating.","```json

"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)

Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!

For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!

Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.

Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.",5,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, showcasing an exceptional experience. The reviewer's sentiment is highly enthusiastic, using numerous superlatives and emotionally charged language ('happily surprised,' 'amazing,' 'huge,' 'delish,' 'FRESH,' 'delicious,' 'drooling,' 'HEAVENLY,' 'blissful,' 'perfect').

Specific feedback is abundant and positive across all key areas:
-   **Food Quality:** Described as 'amazing,' 'fresh,' 'delicious,' 'heavenly,' with 'so many flavors.' Portions are highlighted as 'huge,' leading to leftovers. Specific dishes like mint tea, sabzi (praised for freshness and aroma), spinach herb stew, vegetable stew with eggplant, and a pomegranate walnut tofu special receive rave reviews. Even dishes that were 'ok' (dolmeh, Mast Va Mosear) were not described negatively, just less preferred than others.
-   **Service:** Exceptional. The reviewer details being 'greeted kindly,' receiving a complimentary 'plate of fruit to munch on,' and being pleasantly surprised by the 'made to order' customization for dietary needs (garlic). This bespoke service is noted as a unique positive.
-   **Atmosphere:** Described as 'perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.'
-   **Value:** While acknowledging it's 'a bit pricey,' the reviewer explicitly defends the cost, stating, 'You get what you pay for' in the context of vegetarian and organic food. The huge portions further reinforce a perception of good value.

There are virtually no complaints; the only slight nuance is a preference for one appetizer over another ('both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better'), which is far from a negative point. The reviewer also actively refutes a prior negative review regarding payment methods, indicating their experience directly contradicts it. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, with a clear call to action: 'go here and check it out.' This aligns perfectly with a 5-star rating for an exceptional and highly recommended experience.","```json

"It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.",5,5,"This review is overwhelmingly positive and highly enthusiastic, warranting a 5-star rating.

2.  **Language Intensity:** The language intensity is very high. Superlatives and strong positive descriptors ('pretty awesome,' 'excellent,' 'both great,' 'preferred place') are used consistently throughout the review, indicating a profound and memorable positive experience.

3.  **Specific Feedback:** The reviewer provides concrete details:
    *   **Food Quality:** Describes the food as 'excellent' and 'great,' specifically mentioning 'raw taco's' and 'blueberry fields salad.' 
    *   **Dietary Accommodation:** Highlights its suitability for a 'raw diet,' which is a key positive for a niche market.
    *   **Portion Size:** Praises 'large portions.'
    *   **Value:** Notes 'good price' and favorably compares it to more expensive options in other cities.
    *   **Location:** Mentions its convenient proximity to the airport (10 min drive), which is valuable information for travelers.

4.  **Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer explicitly states, 'it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix,' which is a very strong and clear indication of high recommendation and intent to return. The overall enthusiastic tone also implicitly recommends the place highly.

5.  **Complaint Severity:** There are no complaints mentioned. The only potential 'issue' ('appetizer but that ended up being too much food') is framed as a positive, indicating generous portion sizes rather than dissatisfaction. There are absolutely no negative points or concerns raised.","```json

"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior",5,5,"The reviewer expresses an exceptionally positive and enthusiastic experience from start to finish. The opening statement, 'Really?

"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special!

"I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.  I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.  I had never done any type of ""personal training"" so I was a little apprehensive....and...

I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!  

Case in point:
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, ""Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?""  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like ""this is cake""...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it. 

My Checklist:  
Sense of accomplishment (check)
Strength building (check)

"Great facial great customer service

One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.

I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using. 

Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.

Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!",5,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer uses strong superlatives and enthusiastic language such as ""Great facial,"" ""super cute and inviting,"" ""love the way it's decorated,"" ""awesome!"", ""AMAZING,"" and ""Amanda is great.""

Service is highlighted as exceptional, particularly Amanda's knowledge and skill during the facial, and her attentive accommodation of a specific request regarding hair. Value is also implied through the free upgrade to an anti-aging facial and the inclusion of eyebrow waxing.

The only initial negative point was the cancellation of the first appointment, which caused ""disappointment."" However, the severity of this complaint is very low as the reviewer acknowledges the understandable reason (""contagious illness"") and, more importantly, the issue was resolved exceptionally well with a complimentary upgrade. This demonstrates excellent customer service recovery, turning a potential negative into a strong positive.

Recommendation likelihood is extremely high, explicitly stated with ""I will definitely be back!"" The review aligns perfectly with a 5-star rating due to the exceptional experience, high enthusiasm, strong recommendation, and the effective resolution of the minimal initial inconvenience.","```json

"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.",5,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment.

The reviewer also details a successful birthday dinner experience, stating the place 'didn't let me down' and provided 'good food, good drinks, and a good time.' A unique positive aspect is the disclosure about the restaurant's community involvement, which adds another layer of appreciation.

"I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.

"Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care. Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...

The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like ""OMG"". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And they're probably right. They usually are.

Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's).

The decor, described as a 'late 70's time machine,' is framed as a distinct positive, appreciated for its 'historic flare' and even rationalized as contributing to the food quality. The reviewer's two decades of patronage and unwavering praise point to an exceptionally high recommendation likelihood. Crucially, there are absolutely no complaints; any potential negative (outdated decor) is actively reinterpreted as a positive. This aligns perfectly with a 5-star rating, signifying an exceptional experience with strong enthusiasm and zero issues.""

"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the ""main"" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.

$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.

Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!",5,5,"This review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment. The reviewer uses highly intense language and superlatives consistently throughout. Phrases like 'must check out,' 'just as good if not better,' 'sashimi heaven,' and 'the best I have ever tasted anywhere' strongly convey an exceptional experience.

The specific feedback is rich and focuses on both quality and value. The reviewer praises the 'Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu' for offering full-sized rolls that taste 'just as good if not better' than standard offerings. Hamachi sashimi is highlighted for its '5 large cuts' at a low price ($7), leading to 'sashimi heaven.' The Ikura is singled out as the 'best I have ever tasted anywhere.' Furthermore, the review emphasizes remarkable affordability for beverages ($3.25 beers, $1.95 sodas with free refills), underscoring the restaurant's excellent value proposition.

The recommendation likelihood is extremely high. The reviewer directly instructs prospective customers ('must check out') and provides specific advice to enhance their visit. The concluding rhetorical question ('Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!') acts as a powerful endorsement, positioning Sakana as superior in quality and price compared to other markets.

There are absolutely no complaints mentioned in the review. The entire narrative is dedicated to highlighting positive aspects and guiding others to a similar exceptional experience. This aligns perfectly with a 5-star rating, indicative of an exceptional, highly enthusiastic experience with strong recommendations and no discernible complaints.","```json

"They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai. 

If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!",5,5,"The reviewer expresses an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic sentiment towards Dara Thai. This is evident through the use of strong superlatives like 'BEST Pad Thai' and 'all delicious,' alongside vivid imagery such as the Pad Thai 'haunt[ing] my dreams at night (in a good way).' The language intensity is exceptionally high, underscored by the reviewer's willingness to 'drive 20 miles more' for Dara Thai's Pad Thai, despite acknowledging another highly-rated restaurant, 'Touch of Thai,' is only 5 miles away and offers a comparably good taste (with a different noodle type). 

Specific feedback is concentrated on the food quality: the Pad Thai is singled out for its 'wide, flat noodles' as a key differentiator, and other dishes are generally praised. The reviewer also provides explicit, strong recommendations for the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea, describing them as 'delicious.' There are absolutely no complaints regarding Dara Thai. The comparison to 'Touch of Thai' serves only to further highlight Dara Thai's superior appeal based on a specific preference. The recommendation likelihood is extremely high, bordering on zealous.

"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:

You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.

You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.

You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.

The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.

If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!",2,5,"This review presents a complex and paradoxical sentiment. While it uses highly negative descriptive language ('crappiest place known to man,' 'shitty neighborhood where you might die,' 'low lifes'), the underlying emotional tone is one of enthusiastic appreciation, thrill, and strong recommendation for a very specific type of experience. The reviewer repeatedly returns, explicitly stating, 'So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here.' The language intensity is extremely high, filled with hyperbole and vivid, dramatic imagery, creating an unforgettable narrative. Specific feedback includes the bar being cash-only, offering only chips for food, serving PBR pitchers, and being located in a 'shitty' neighborhood. However, these conventional 'complaints' are presented not as deterrents, but as defining characteristics that contribute to the unique, chaotic, and 'eventful' nights the reviewer clearly enjoys and actively seeks out. The recommendation likelihood is exceptionally high, but highly targeted: it is strongly recommended for those looking for a wild, unpredictable, and chaotic night, and explicitly not for those seeking a quiet evening. The perceived complaint severity, while superficially high, is effectively nullified by the reviewer's embrace of these aspects as integral to their 'exceptional' experience. The final sentence, 'If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!', serves as a powerful, enthusiastic endorsement, indicating an exceptional and highly cherished experience for the reviewer's specific preferences, despite (or perhaps because of) its unconventional nature.","```json

"Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.

Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as ""hard rock"" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well. 

Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.",2,2,"This review exhibits a predominantly disappointed and critical sentiment, despite acknowledging some positive aspects. The reviewer's overall experience leans heavily towards dissatisfaction, specifically regarding the core offering and atmosphere of the Hard Rock Cafe.

**1. Sentiment Analysis:** The dominant emotional tone is one of disappointment and mild disillusionment. Phrases like 'only memorable for' and 'do not bang my shutters' convey a lack of excitement and a feeling that the experience did not meet expectations. While service is positively noted ('attentive,' 'frequently refilled'), the general mood is critical of the venue's atmosphere, value, and brand alignment.

**2. Language Intensity:** The language intensity is moderate to strong in expressing negatives. 'Jungle like humidity' is a vivid and potent descriptor of discomfort. 'Overpriced drinks' is a direct and strong negative evaluation of value. The idiom 'do not bang my shutters' is a strong, albeit colloquial, way of expressing a complete lack of impressiveness or interest. Positively, 'gorgeous face and voice' is a high compliment for the performer, but it's isolated to that specific element.

**3. Specific Feedback:**
    *   **Service:** Highly positive (attentive servers, frequent drink refills).
    *   **Atmosphere/Ambiance:** Heavily negative (jungle-like humidity, very small space, sparsely populated, too 'family friendly' for a 'hard rock' theme).
    *   **Entertainment:** Positive, but specific to one performer (Amanda Peachey's face and voice).
    *   **Value:** Negative ('overpriced drinks').
    *   **Food Quality:** Not mentioned at all.
    *   **Brand Experience:** Negative (doesn't feel 'hard rock,' signed guitars are not impressive).

**4. Recommendation Likelihood:** The reviewer is highly unlikely to recommend this Hard Rock Cafe to others, especially those looking for a 'hard rock' experience or good value. The concluding sentence strongly indicates a lack of satisfaction with the fundamental offering.

**5. Complaint Severity:** The complaints regarding humidity and overpriced drinks are of moderate to high severity, directly impacting comfort and value perception. The disappointment with the atmosphere, size, sparse population, and perceived lack of 'hard rock' authenticity are also significant, as they undermine the core brand experience. While service was good, it doesn't outweigh these substantial drawbacks.

**Conclusion for Star Rating:** The good service and appreciation for a performer prevent a 1-star rating. However, the significant and numerous negatives concerning atmosphere, comfort, value, and overall brand experience firmly place this review in the 'below average' category. The reviewer expresses clear disappointment and unlikeliness to return, aligning well with a 2-star rating.","```json
